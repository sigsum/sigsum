    https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/filippo/witness-pull/proposals/2022-11-witness-pull.md
  - Concrete follow-up proposal that aims to be a small diff compared to current api:

  - One of several ways to setup a proxy for witnesses without public addresses:

  - Recall checkpoint format:

## Agenda

  - Witnessing communication pattern(s)
  - Tree head and cosignature format (if time permits)

Key question: should we keep the current witnessing design and in addition to
that support what is in witnessing.md after some polishing, or do we consider
the option of "private witnesses" that are reachable via proxies good enough?

## Summary

  - Sounds good to to split up specifications into log.md and witness.md.  The
    former defines aspects of the sigsum log and its endpoints.  The latter
    defines log-witness interactions ("how a log gets its cosignatures").
  - We don't consider it a regression to remove the current witnessing pattern
    and instead rely on a reverse proxy to reach "private witnesses".  We would
    like to run such proxies as separate components on our sigsum log servers.
    Nice that this can work for both public, serverless, and low-latency logs.
  - Move timestamp to cosignature and keep it, important for some of our
    intended use-cases.  Overall a simplification compared to what we have now.
  - Hash out the details of possibly moving into the note format if filippo
    proposes this, document motivation and take the pragmatic approach.  The
    main blocker before was that we couldn't find a good place for witness
    timestamps, and that seems to be a solved problem now.  One worry here is
    that if we start changing formats there might be ripple effects in other
    parts of sigsum.  (And we would like to sooner rather than later allow for
    our pilot use-cases to be demonstrated with a log + tooling.  One option
    that was discussed is that if this becomes an issue in ~Jan, we can tag v0.9
    and commit to that for some time while communicating that a v1 is still
    brewing with regards to X,Y,Z.  Updating use-cases we control is doable.)
  - Ask that filippo (continues) to drive the above forward, and once specs are
    in a good state also take charge of creating new witness+proxy artifact(s).

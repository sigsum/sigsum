Status round
	* [rgdd] slow-down attack on the current checkpoint format
		* https://git.sigsum.org/sigsum/tree/archive/2021-08-24-checkpoint-timestamp?id=d8a070ad281b8fb8fed788d2d2c293f8bb343210
	* [rgdd] should a checkpoint's [otherdata] be less undefined?
		* https://git.sigsum.org/sigsum/tree/archive/2021-08-24-checkpoint-otherdata?id=d8a070ad281b8fb8fed788d2d2c293f8bb343210

		* https://git.sigsum.org/sigsum/commit/?id=8f2b510b7974bd95de7c08372931da4b0317b97c
	* [ln5] services
		* git.sigsum.org up and running with mirroring to GitHub
		* pad.sigsum.org under way -- poc is running but won't persist pads at the moment
		* DFRI will sponsor with mailing lists
			* sigsum-general@lists.sigsum.org to be set up real soon now

Discuss
	* Services
		* GitHub
			* Configure our accounts so that we can't push there by mistake
			* Add "readonly mirror" in description
			* OK to report issues on GitHub, no PRs though
		* Budget for the components that lead up to a patched OS?
			* Context: what is a reasonable budget for self-hosting?
			* Reference: what is the cost for a single VM with a VPS?
				* Ballpark 100SEK per VM (monthly)
				* We need 6 VMs, one of which is hosted in a separate domain for backups
	* Subresource Integrity (SRI) transparency as a poc use-case?
		* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity
		* https://blog.ryotak.me/post/cdnjs-remote-code-execution-en/
		* Decision: good idea, defer until later

Next steps
	* [ln5] render web page (hugo) and publish
	* [ln5] set up sigsum-general@lists
	* [ln5] finish pad.sigsum.org
	* [ln5] get meet.sigsum.org up and running (jitsi)
	* [rgdd] keep conversation going about checkpoint format
	* [rgdd] complete design.md updates, update api.md and break out witnessing
	* [rgdd] look into GitHub TODOs, see above discuss item

Other useful links
	* None

Hello
	* rgdd
	* nisse
	* ln5 (voice only)
	* gregoire
	* filippo
	* foxboron

Status round
	* [nisse] ascii refactor in progress
		* Merged sigsum-go changes
		* sigsum-py barely started
		* log-go under review: https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/core/log-go/-/merge_requests/27
	* [nisse] rate-limiting tests in progress
	* [nisse] looking into merkle-tree details, to get a better understanding of state on db side. Current design requires a "reverse map" from leaf hash --> index, which makes things more complex (in terms of either code complexity or needed working storage). I think this is worth a deeper look for v2.
	* [nisse] merged AUTHORS file mr.
	* [rgdd, filippo] discuss tlogs and some aspects of sigsum, brief summary:
		* https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/archive/2022-11-08-tlog-notes
	* [filippo] wrote up two draft proposals based on the discussion with rgdd
		* https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/merge_requests/13
	* [gregoire] ssh-agent support for witness
		* https://gitlab.sigsum.org/sigsum/core/sigsum-py/-/merge_requests/6
	* [gregoire] python packaging

Decisions
	* Decision: update meet time to 1215 UTC

Next steps
	* [nisse] review ssh agent in witness, merging ascii and rate limiting things
	* [gregoire] sigsum-py packaging with poetry
	* [morten, ln5] get started with ansible stuff/examples for sigsum
	* [gregoire] trillian-images and docker-compose setup to test witness
	* everyone: think about the added proposals

	* Regarding storage, here's an efficient implementation in C supporting the CT case (and more, supposedly):

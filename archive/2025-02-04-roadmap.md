# 2025-02-04

This document provides an overview of Sigsum's roadmap and people with standing
responsibilities.  A new roadmap will be decided towards the end of May, 2025.

## High-level priorities

In roughly this order whenever possible:

  1. Sigsum logs are operated with good business continuity
  2. Witnesses are operated with good business continuity
  3. It is easy to use Sigsum
     - Wrt. integrating in something existing ("dev", "submitter")
     - Wrt. being a party that offline-verifies ("end-user")
     - Wrt. being a party that online-verifies ("monitor")
  4. Further development (broader and possibly experimental)

From these high-level priorities we define shorter-term activities.

## Main activities until the end of May, 2025

The main activities are:

  - **Take a stab at metrics and test+document log failover**
    - https://git.glasklar.is/groups/sigsum/-/milestones/21#tab-issues
    - Work by: elias, ln5
    - Review by: nisse for core/ changes
    - Relates to: priority (1)
    - Expected done: before next roadmap renewal
  - **Address backlogged maintenance in Sigsum's ansible collection**
    - https://git.glasklar.is/groups/sigsum/-/milestones/20#tab-issues
    - Relates to: priorities (1) and (2)
    - Work by: elias
    - Review by: ln5, rgdd
    - Expected done: before next roadmap renewal
  - **Address backlogged maintenance and feature requests in Sigsum's tooling**
    - https://git.glasklar.is/groups/sigsum/-/milestones/19#tab-issues
    - Relates to: priority (3)
    - Work and review by: nisse, rgdd
    - Expected done: before next roadmap renewal
  - **Dogfood use of Sigsum as a building block in ST**
    - Relates to: priority (3)
    - Work and review by: nisse, rgdd
    - Expected done: no estimate, expected outcome is to contribute some
      improvements to the monitor library in core/ the coming ~months
  - **Continue to explore the "shared configuration" ideas**.
    - Relates to: priorities (1), (2), (4)
    - Point of contact: rgdd
    - Expected done: no estimate, the next step is to continue the on-and-off
      discussions with Google's Trust Fabric team
    - (See the links further down in this document for some additional context)
  - TODO(@filippo): To be added
    - named/default policies?
    - witness in sunlight?
    - maps?
    - go sumdb witnessing?

Support, bug fixing, and other maintenance is in scope and planned separately
when needed.

## What happens after May, 2025

To be decided, but we don't expect any major changes in high-level priorities.

For hints on what might be selected as the main activities in the future, refer
to Sigsum's [issue boards][] and (sometimes "DRAFT:") [milestones][].  You can
try filtering on the GitLab ["Future" tag][].  If you have input on what you
want to see work on, file and comment on issues or reach out as you see fit.

## Summary of progress since October, 2024

A few highlights:

  - New litewitness and litebastion releases, see v0.3.0--v0.4.1 in the
    [release notes](https://github.com/FiloSottile/litetlog/blob/v0.4.1/NEWS.md)
  - New ansible collection releases, see v0.2.X
    [release notes](https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/admin/ansible/-/blob/main/docs/docsite/rst/CHANGELOG.rst)
  - New sigsum-go release, see v0.10.X in the
    [NEWS file](https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/core/sigsum-go/-/blob/main/NEWS?ref_type=heads).
  - FOSDEM talk "Sigsum: Detecting rouge signatures through transparency"

    - https://git.glasklar.is/nisse/fosdem-sigsum-2025/-/blob/main/slides.pdf
  - Example prototypes that use Sigsum as a building block
    - [Release verification for the encryption-tool age][].  There are some
      [discussions][] relating to a more general `sigsum-release-verify`.
    - [Tamper-evident log of commands executed via SSH][]
  - (Not very thoroughly discussed) notes on what a sigsum/v2 might look like.
    Think of the below notes as *what would at least have been considered*.
    There are no short-term plans to do any work on a sigsum v1.1 or v2.
    - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/archive/2024-11-04-sigsum-v2-ideas
  - System Transparency accepted a proposal to add support for Sigsum-logged OS
    packages, backwards-compatible implementation is still ongoing
    - https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/project/documentation/-/blob/main/proposals/2024-12-09-sigsum-logged-os-package-2.md
    - https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/project/documentation/-/blob/main/archive/2025-01-07-meeting-minutes.md
  - Glasklar Teknik documented the operations of their stable Sigsum log
    - TODO(@rgdd): link to about page
  - Glasklar Teknik started operating a stable witness
    - TODO(@rgdd): link to about page
  - The above about pages are part of the immediate next steps that were
    identified when sketching on a 3rd-party service that helps with shared
    configuration for logs and witnesses.  This is an on-and-off ongoing
    discussion with Al and Martin from the Google Trust Fabric team.

    - So far no concrete decisions on anything

We did not have enough cycles to complete the [maintenance and minor-fixes
milestone](https://git.glasklar.is/groups/sigsum/-/milestones/19#tab-issues).

TODO(@filippo): are there any map things to point to?

TODO(@filippo): are there any sunlight or witness ops things to point to?

TODO(@filippo): anything else you want to point at (or backlog)?

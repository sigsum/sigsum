# 2025-02-04

This document provides an overview of Sigsum's roadmap and people with standing
responsibilities.  A new roadmap will be decided towards the end of May, 2025.

## High-level priorities

In roughly this order whenever possible:

  1. Sigsum logs are operated with good business continuity
  2. Witnesses are operated with good business continuity
  3. It is easy to use Sigsum
     - Wrt. integrating into something existing
     - Wrt. being a party that offline-verifies
     - Wrt. being a party that monitors
  4. Further development (broader and possibly experimental)

From these high-level priorities we define shorter-term activities.

## Main activities until the end of May, 2025

The main activities are:

  - **Take a stab at metrics and test+document log failover**
    - https://git.glasklar.is/groups/sigsum/-/milestones/21#tab-issues
    - Work by: elias, ln5
    - Review by: nisse for core/ changes
    - Relates to: priority (1)
    - Expected done: before next roadmap renewal
  - **Address backlogged maintenance in Sigsum's ansible collection**
    - https://git.glasklar.is/groups/sigsum/-/milestones/20#tab-issues
    - Relates to: priorities (1) and (2)
    - Work by: elias
    - Review by: ln5, rgdd
    - Expected done: before next roadmap renewal
  - **Address backlogged maintenance and feature requests in Sigsum's tooling**
    - https://git.glasklar.is/groups/sigsum/-/milestones/19#tab-issues
    - Relates to: priority (3)
    - Work and review by: nisse, rgdd
    - Expected done: before next roadmap renewal
  - **Dogfood use of Sigsum as a building block in ST**
    - Relates to: priority (3)
    - Work and review by: nisse, rgdd
    - Expected done: no estimate, expected outcome is to contribute several
      improvements to the monitor library in core/ the coming ~months
  - **Continue to explore the "shared configuration" ideas**.
    - Relates to: priorities (1), (2), (4)
    - Point of contact: rgdd
    - Expected done: no estimate, the next step is to continue the on-and-off
      discussions with Google's Trust Fabric team
    - (See the links further down in this document for some additional context)
  - **Look into ways of getting rid of trust-policy [EOF blurbs][]**.
    - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/core/sigsum-go/-/issues/51
    - Relates to: priority (3)
    - Work by: filippo
    - Review by: rgdd
    - Expected done: at minimum a proposal before the next roadmap renewal.
      Ideally the proposal is accepted so that implementation is not blocked.

Support, bug fixing, and other maintenance is in scope and planned separately
when needed.

## What happens after May, 2025

To be decided, but we don't expect any major changes in high-level priorities.

For hints on what might be selected as the main activities in the future, refer
to Sigsum's [issue boards][] and (sometimes "DRAFT:") [milestones][].  You can
try filtering on the GitLab ["Future" tag][].  If you have input on what you
want to see work on, file and comment on issues or reach out as you see fit.

    [NEWS file](https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/core/sigsum-go/-/blob/v0.10.1/NEWS?ref_type=tags#L1-31).

      [discussions][] relating to a more general `sigsum-release-verify`.
    - [Tamper-evident log of commands executed via SSH][]
  - (Not very thoroughly discussed) notes on what a sigsum/v2 might look like.
    Think of the below notes as *what would at least have been considered*.
    There are no short-term plans to do any work on a sigsum v1.1 or v2.
    - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/archive/2024-11-04-sigsum-v2-ideas
  - System Transparency accepted a proposal to add support for Sigsum-logged OS
    packages, backwards-compatible implementation is still ongoing

  - Glasklar Teknik started operating a stable witness
    - https://git.glasklar.is/glasklar/services/witnessing/-/blob/main/witness.glasklar.is/about.md
  - Glasklar Teknik documented the operations of their stable Sigsum log
    - https://git.glasklar.is/glasklar/services/sigsum-logs/-/blob/main/instances/seasalp.md
  - The above about pages are part of the immediate next steps that were
    identified when sketching on a 3rd-party service that helps with shared
    configuration for logs and witnesses.  This is an on-and-off ongoing
    discussion with Al and Martin from the Google Trust Fabric team.

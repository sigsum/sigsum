DRAFT, we're still discussing if any of the main activities can be deferred.

XXX: bring sigsum proof and/or trust policy format into stable, and later be
open to have a different encoding as suggested a few sigsum meets ago?

# 2025-02-04

This document provides an overview of Sigsum's roadmap and people with standing
responsibilities.  A new roadmap will be decided towards the end of May, 2025.

## High-level priorities

In roughly this order whenever possible:

  1. Sigsum logs are operated with good business continuity
  2. Witnesses are operated with good business continuity
  3. It is easy to use Sigsum
     - Wrt. integrating in something existing ("dev")
     - Wrt. being a party that offline-verifies ("end-user")
     - Wrt. being a party that online-verifies ("monitor")
  4. Further development (broader and possibly experimental)

From these priorities we define shorter-term activities.

## Main activities until the end of May, 2025

The main activities are:

  - **Address backlogged maintenance in Sigsum's ansible collection**
    - https://git.glasklar.is/groups/sigsum/-/milestones/20#tab-issues
    - Relates to: priorities (1) and (2), also onboards elias more
    - Work by: elias
    - Review by: ln5, rgdd
    - Expected done: before next roadmap renewal
  - **Take a stab at metrics and test+document log failover**
    - TODO(@elias,ln5,rgdd): milestone
    - Work by: elias
    - Review by: nisse and rgdd (core/), ln5 (sysadm)
    - Relates to: priority (1)
    - Expected done: before next roadmap renewal
  - **Address backlogged maintenance and feature requests in Sigsum's tooling**
    - https://git.glasklar.is/groups/sigsum/-/milestones/19#tab-issues
    - Relates to: priority (3) and standing maintenance
    - Work and review by: nisse, rgdd
    - Expected done: before next roadmap renewal
  - **Dogfood use of Sigsum as a building block in ST**
    - TODO(@rgdd): link to ST milestone
    - Relates to: priority (3)
    - Work and review by: nisse, rgdd
    - Expected done: unclear, but at least some progress the coming months.
      Some of the progress may happen out-of-tree to learn by doing rapidly.
      The goal is to contribute back useful improvements into sigsum/core.
  - **Be active in the progress on a 3rd-party service to discover log/witness
    configurations.**  This is done in collaboration with Google Trust Fabric.
    - Relates to: priorities (1), (2), (4)
    - Point of contact: rgdd
    - Expected done: unclear, but at least some progress the coming months
  - TODO(@filippo): To be added
    - named/default policies?
    - witness in sunlight?
    - maps?
    - go sumdb witnessing?

Support, bug fixing, and other maintenance is in scope and planned separately
when needed.

## What happens after May, 2025

To be decided, but we don't expect any major changes in high-level priorities.

For hints on what might be selected as the main activities in the future, refer
to Sigsum's [issue boards][] and (sometimes "DRAFT:") [milestones][].  You can
try filtering on the GitLab "Future" tag.  If you have input on what you want to
see work on, please file and comment on issues or reach out as you see fit.

  - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/archive/2024-10-29--meeting-minutes.md#decisions

## Summary of progress since October, 2024

A few highlights:

  - New litewitness and litebastion releases, see v0.3.0--v0.4.1 in the
    [release notes](https://github.com/FiloSottile/litetlog/blob/main/NEWS.md)
  - New ansible collection releases, see v0.2.X--vX.Y.Z in the
    [release notes](https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/admin/ansible/-/blob/main/docs/docsite/rst/CHANGELOG.rst)
  - New sigsum-go tags, see vX.X.X--v.Y.Y.Y in the
    [NEWS file](TODO).
    - Notably (from the top of rgdd's head): vkey conversion, proof v2 format
  - FOSDEM talk "Sigsum: Detecting rouge signatures through transparency"
    - https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5661-sigsum-detecting-rogue-signatures-through-transparency/
    - https://git.glasklar.is/nisse/fosdem-sigsum-2025/-/blob/main/slides.pdf
  - Example prototypes that use Sigsum as a building block
    - [Release verification for the encryption-tool age][].  There are some
      [discussions][] relating to a more general `sigsum-release-verify`.
    - [Tamper-evident log of commands executed via SSH][]
  - (Not very thoroughly discussed) notes on what a sigsum/v2 might look like.
    Think of the below notes as *what would at least have been considered*.
    There are no short-term plans to do any work on a sigsum v1.1 or v2.
    - TODO(@rgdd): persist https://pad.sigsum.org/p/19fe-e132-b60b-7a47-7839-c8b9-96e3-52c9
  - System Transparency accepted a proposal to add support for Sigsum-logged OS
    packages, backwards-compatible implementation is still ongoing
    - https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/project/documentation/-/blob/main/proposals/2024-12-09-sigsum-logged-os-package-2.md
    - TODO(@rgdd): link to decision notes
  - Glasklar Teknik documented the operations of their stable Sigsum log
    - TODO(@rgdd): link to about page
  - Glasklar Teknik started operating a stable witness
    - TODO(@rgdd): link to about page
  - The above documentation is part of the immediate next steps that were
    identified when sketching on a 3rd-party service that helps with shared
    configuration for logs and witnesses.  This is an on-and-off ongoing
    discussion with Al and Martin from the Google Trust Fabric team.

    - TODO(@rgdd): can we link Al's doc?
    - So far no concrete decisions on anything

We did not have enough cycles to complete the [maintenance and minor-fixes
milestone](https://git.glasklar.is/groups/sigsum/-/milestones/19#tab-issues).

TODO(@filippo): are there any map things to point to?

TODO(@filippo): are there any sunlight or witness ops things to point to?

TODO(@filippo): anything else you want to point at (or backlog)?

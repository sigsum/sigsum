Email address for registering a witness, both with a bastion host and with a log
server.

Prop 1. No connection between email address and DNS name for the service.

Prop 2. Use WELL-KNOWN@<domain-name-for-service>, f.ex.
witness-registration@bastion.glasklar.is


Prop 1 is better because simple.

Rationale for why prop 2 is not worth it: 
- A new service needs to commuinicate metadata anyway, so the need for an email
  address for witness registration doesn't change anything wrt that.
- We could add some flexibility later things using SRV or TXT records.
- Requiring an MTA for @<domain-name-for-service> is potentially demotivating
  for service operators.

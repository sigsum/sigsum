TL;DR:

  - git-bug is cool but does not seem to be mature enough yet.

Some notes from rgdd:

  - Command-line UX works well locally.
  - It took me several attempts to get "git bug pull|push" work without SSH
    errors.  There are several issues related to this from early 2021 @ GH.
  - Bridge mode can be setup when compiling from source.  Pulling and pushing
    from GH works to some extent, but is buggy and includes git-bug panics.
  - Issues are stored in git's internal storage (.git/).  This is why git-bug
    doesn't pollute a repo with commits related to issue tracking.  I am a bit
    worried that git-bug will break and that we need to debug this format.
  - It was not immeaditely obvious to me how to git push|pull the internal
    storage without using git-bug (if so, maybe it would be an OK hot-fix).
    
Further notes from Anwesha:

  - Not packaged for Debian. Installing from source may not be a good idea for
    production.
  - "This is now more than a proof of concept, but still not fully stable.
    Expect dragons and unfinished business." Where the developers of the project
    themselves are saying that it is an unstable version then it is red flag for
    me.

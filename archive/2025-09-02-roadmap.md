# 2025-09-02

This document provides an overview of Sigsum's roadmap and people with standing
responsibilities.  A new roadmap will be decided in the beginning of November.

## High-level priorities

In roughly this order whenever possible:

  1. Sigsum logs are operated with good business continuity
  2. Witnesses are operated with good business continuity
  3. It is easy to use Sigsum
     - Wrt. integrating into something existing
     - Wrt. being a party that offline-verifies
     - Wrt. being a party that monitors
  4. Further development (broader and possibly experimental)

From these high-level priorities we define shorter-term activities.

## Main activities until the end of October, 2025

The main activities are:

  - **C2SP specifications**
    - Relates to: interoperability
    - Work by: filippo, rgdd
    - Review by: maintainers
    - Expected outcome
      - There is a merged vkey specification
      - Release candidate specifications get proper v1 tags
      - Stay in touch with Merkle tree certificate folks
    - Expected done: end of October (for the first two points)
  - **Getting started documentation for witnessing**
    - Relates to: priority (2)
    - Work by: ln5
    - Review by: elias
    - Expected outcome:
      - A single entrypoint that can be linked from Sigsum's website, doesn't
        have to be perfect but improves on the status quo (no coherent page)
      - Document the information a new witness operator would want to know
      - The starting point for this should be the information we usually share
        on request (a collection of links), as well as recently received
        [feedback](https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/archive/2025-07-02-witness-setup-feedback.md)
    - Expected done: end of October
  - **Dogfood witness configuration prototype and collect input**
    - Relates to: (1), (2), (4)
    - Work and review by: rgdd, filippo, others interested in testing/shaping
    - Expected outcome:
      - Ensure there is support for using the log list in sunlight and
        litewitness
      - Collect input from early usage
      - Be prepared for a breakout session on this topic during the
        Transparency.dev summit
    - Expected done: end of October
    - More info: <https://git.glasklar.is/rgdd/witness-configuration-network>
  - **One bastion host per (public) Sigsum log**
    - Relates to: (1), (2), (4)
    - Work and review by: rgdd, ln5
    - Expected outcome:
      - Design
      - Implementation
      - At minimum prototype use
      - Documentation that facilitates conversation and convergence
    - Expected done: end of October
    - More info: <https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/core/log-go/-/issues/70>
  - **Develop Sigsum TKey apps**
    - Relates to: (1), (2), (3)
    - Work and review by: nisse, Tillitis
    - Expected outcome:
      - A signer app that only signs transparency-logged messages
      - A log app that only signs tree heads that are append-only
      - A witness app that only signs tree heads that are append-only
      - A sigsum-c repository (or the start of what will become sigsum-c)
      - Possibly integration/prototyping with Sigsum's existing Go code
    - Expected done: end of October
    - More info: https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/issues/69
  - **Minor improvements and fixes in core/**
    - Relates to: onboarding, maintenance
    - Work by: elias
    - Review by: nisse
    - Expected outcome:
      - Elias gets more familiar with Sigsum's codebase and Go
      - Small improvements and fixes, see [milestone](https://git.glasklar.is/groups/sigsum/-/milestones/22#tab-issues)
    - Expected done: end of October
  - **Implement first revision of named trust policies**
    - Relates to: priority (3)
    - Work by: elias
    - Review by: nisse
    - Expected outcome:
      - Implementation and documentation based on [accepted
        proposal](https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/proposals/2025-07-named-policies.md)
      - A named policy for both test usage and production usage
    - Expected done: end of October

Support, bug fixing, and other maintenance is in scope and planned separately
when needed.

## What happens after October, 2025

To be decided, but we don't expect any major changes in high-level priorities.

For hints on what might be selected as the main activities in the future, refer
to Sigsum's [issue boards][] and (sometimes "DRAFT:") [milestones][].  You can
try filtering on the GitLab ["Future" tag][].  If you have input on what you
want to see work on, file and comment on issues or reach out as you see fit.

## Previous roadmap from May, 2025

  - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/archive/2025-05-27-roadmap.md
  - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/archive/2025-05-27--meeting-minutes.md#decisions

## Summary of progress since February, 2025

A few highlights:

  - New experimental sigsum monitor by florolf is available for testing
    - https://github.com/florolf/sigmon
  - A detailed log failover procedure is available
    - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/core/log-go/-/blob/main/doc/failover.md?ref_type=heads#more-detailed-failover-description-and-test-procedure
  - New ansible collection release, see v1.4.0 in the
    [release notes](https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/admin/ansible/-/blob/v1.4.0/NEWS?ref_type=tags#L1-23)
  - Accepted proposal on named trust policies
    - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/proposals/2025-07-named-policies.md
  - Drafty prototype of witness configuration network (under discussion)
    - https://git.glasklar.is/rgdd/witness-configuration-network

We did not have enough cycles to:

  - Page in the maintenance and onboarding milestone (continued in the upcoming roadmap)
  - Implement named trust policies (continued in the upcoming roadmap)
  - Do anything with regard to Prometheus and log metrics (backlogged for now)
  - Do anything on sigsum-go's monitor code (backlogged for now)
    - See the above sigmon monitor by florof though, it is in many regards more
      mature than sigsum-go's current sigsum-monitor implementation (e.g.,
      sigmon verifies cosignatures and supports non-continuous running modes)

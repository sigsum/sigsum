# 2024-01-30

This document provides a sketch of the current roadmap and involved people.

## Summary of changes

The last roadmap was documented and decided here:

  - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/archive/2023-11-07-roadmap.md
  - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/archive/2023-11-07--meeting-minutes.md

The overall progress can be summarized as follows:

  - We attended [CATS][], including giving a full talk and a lightning talk.
  - We figured out [open-source governance and maintenance][] of specifications.
  - We developed [key management][] for logs and witnesses using YubiHSMs.
  - We took an initial stab at improving our documentation, e.g., including
    updating `www.sigsum.org` and many of the resources that it is linking.

All progress on [monitoring][] and [getting started with operations][] were
backlogged (key management is a step in the right direction though).  Some of
the things we [set out to solve][] with regard to documentation are still open
or ongoing, such as producing the next iteration of our specifications.

## Roadmap

The current priorities are as follows:

  1. Progress on specifications
  2. Sigsum logs are operated with good business continuity
  3. Witnesses are operated with good business continuity
  4. Use-cases of Sigsum
  5. Monitoring for Sigsum use-cases

Until April 2024, we will mainly work on:

  - Collaborating on the family of specifications that are developed and
    maintained in C2SP, e.g., including tlog-witness and https-bastion.
  - Implementing any updated reference specifications in log-go.

Support and bug fixes are in scope and planned separately when needed.  When
revisiting the roadmap next time, we will consider if we are able to take on
more and thus make progress on priorities (2), (3), (4), and (5) as well.

Agenda
	* Hello
	* Status round
	* Decisions
	* Next steps

Hello
	* rgdd
	* filippo
	* morten
	* ln5
	* nisse

Status round
	* [rgdd] read and sync regarding proposals
	* [nisse] Done some refactoring of state manager. Move of timestamp to
	  cosignature in progress.  Few other things related to milestones.
	* [morten] fixup in configuration stuff (nisse is reviewing), and
	  keeping up with nisse's merge requests
	* [filippo] work on mrs, and reached out to al with no resonse yet;
	  played a bit with how to build bastion and witness

Decisions
	* Decision: Drop error= from failure responses
		* Motivation: Value is not specified to be machine friendly
		  anyway. If we later find a usecase for more fine grained
		  errors than the http status code, we should add a message like
		  error=, error_code= + a sigsum-specific content type
		  identifying this format.
	* Decision: Consistently use 403 Forbidden for errors due to an invalid signature
		* https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231#section-6.5.3
	* Decision: Update get-tree-head semantics to the following
		* "Returns a tree head and any associated co-signatures.  The
		  log should wait to update the published tree head until it has
		  collected a satisfactory number of co-signatures. The list of
		  co-signatures may change over time."
	* Decision: Remove get-next-tree-head and add-cosignature
		* [nisse] My preference would be to postpone that decision until
		  the new scheme is implemented. Then we'll have a better
		  understanding of the complexity of keeping both. And I would
		  like to officially deploy a log (be that v1 or v0.9) pretty
		  soon, and then it would be nice to be able to have a gradual
		  migration of the few existing witnesses.
		* [rgdd] it's ok if v0.9 log server doesn't output any
		  cosignatures for now, i.e., just have our get-tree-head
		  endpoint that outputs an STH without cosignatures.  As soon as
		  the witnessing details are finalized / there's an updated
		  witnessing poc, we add support for the log server to collect
		  cosignatures periodically (with high-latency to start with,
		  keeping it simple and similar to today's state manager).
	* Decision: Merge witness.md and bastion.md
		* https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/merge_requests/21/diffs

Next steps
	* [filippo] merge the above, think about if there's any other technical
	  details that would be reasonable to change (related to
	  operatablility); will start a sketch / pseudoproposal. And will try to
	  put together a poc for bastion + witness in go.
	* [nisse] holiday
	* [morten] review stuff from nisse
	* [rgdd] highlevel feeedback, holiday

Other
	* [nisse] Question on command line conventions: we represent keys as
	  private keys, public keys and key hashes, in different contexts. We
	  sometimes pass them directly hex-encoded on the command line,
	  sometimes via a file (with command line specifying the file name).
	  It's clearly bad to pass private keys on the command line (since
	  they're visible in process metadata; hopefully we don't do that). I
	  would suggest always passing also the public keys via files, one
	  reason is to be more consistent with tools like ssh-keygen that
	  produce two files, key + key.pub. I'm more undecided when it comes to
	  key hashes.
		* Take a stab at making this consistent, morten is available as
		  rubberduck.  Note that current log cli is hacky (and under
		  refactoring), and that sigsum-debug is not a good role model
		  for what the (non-debug) sigsum tools should be doing.

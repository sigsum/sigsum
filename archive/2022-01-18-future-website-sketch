Sketch on an updated www.sigsum.org site, feedback wanted.  The goal is to know
roughly what content we want here eventually, and who that content should be
for.

We will use this as input for a web developer that will fix a Hugo template
tailored for Sigsum. The resulting template should be free and open-source
licensed.

Target audience?
---
Somewhat prioritized list:
	1. New users, early adopters, and contributors
		* "The why and how of Sigsum logging"
		* "How to get started and/or involved"
	1. (Non-)technical decisions makers
		* "We want there to be decisions to apply Sigsum in the real world"
	1. Journalists and bloggers
		* "We want to make it easier to bring Sigsum into the conversation"
	1. Technical experts and academics
		* "Point me to the stuff"
	1. Existing users and contributors
		* "Mostly for reference and navigation to the right place"
		* "Probably don't need to access our website that much"

Aim for the overall feeling of "not so dense", "inclusive", and "community".

Website content?
---
	* What is Sigsum, the technology?
	* What is Sigsum useful for?
	* How does it work?
	* How can I try it out?
	* How can I get involved?
	* Who is behind Sigsum, the project?
	* FAQ

Top-most navigation?
---
A first take based on the above could be:
	* Landing page
	* Applications (of the technology)
	* Documentation
	* Ecosystem
	* About

Landing page
	* One liner
	* Example
		* "A free and open source software project that brings transparency to
		cryptographic key-usage"

Applications
	* An enumeration that provides an overview of several "items" containing
		* Title
		* Optional figure
		* 1-3 lines summary
		* Read more button
			* Keep it short and down to the point
			* What is the problem that Sigsum addresses
			* What assumptions are required for the above
			* (Not: "this is how it works in detail", just aim to gauge interest)
	* Two examples of topics to be enumerated
		* "Digital Signatures" / "Signature Transparency"
		* "Executable Binaries" / "Binary Transparency"

Documentation
	* Same type of enumeration as for "Applications"
	* Examples:
		* "How it works"
		* "Getting started"
		* "Frequently asked questions"
		* "Technical documentation", redirect/pointers to git's doc folder

Ecosystem
	* A paragraph of introtext, followed by an enumeration?
		* "The great folks/orgs running logs, witnesses, monitors, etc"
		* Credit: https://certificate.transparency.dev/ does this very nicely.

About
	* Team Sigsum, who are the core people driving the project forward
	* Vision / values
	* Sponsors (maybe "enumeration" as described above is appropriate)

Misc
---
Eventually we might want a blog.  Would that be blog.sigsum.org, linked from doc
page?

Have not worked in where the 'how to get in touch part' should be.  Would be
nice if the following are easily accessible / discoverable:
	* irc
	* matrix
	* mailing list
	* weekly Jitsi meets

Would be nice if every page could have a natural "get involved button".  Think
"Add your use-case", "Add your sigsum log", etc.

# 2026-02-03

This document provides an overview of Sigsum's roadmap and people with standing
responsibilities.  A new roadmap will be decided in the mid of April, 2026.

## High-level priorities

In roughly this order whenever possible:

  1. Sigsum logs are operated with good business continuity
  2. Witnesses are operated with good business continuity
  3. It is easy to use Sigsum
     - Wrt. integrating into something existing
     - Wrt. being a party that offline-verifies
     - Wrt. being a party that monitors
  4. Further development (broader and possibly experimental)

From these high-level priorities we define shorter-term activities.

## Main activities until mid April, 2026

  - **Version 1 release of the TKey sign-if-logged app**
    - Work by: nisse
    - Review by: rgdd + some support/discuss with Tillitis if possible
    - Expected outcome:
      - https://git.glasklar.is/groups/sigsum/-/milestones/24#tab-issues
      - (Same milestone as last roadmap with the expiry date bumped.)
    - Estimated done: towards the end of February / beginning of March
  - **TKey log signer app and integration with log-go**
    - Work by: nisse
    - Review by: rgdd + some support/discuss with Tillitis if possible
    - Expected outcome:
      - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/core/log-go/-/issues/136
    - Estimated done: around end of April?
      - (Will likely carry over until the next roadmap iteration)
  - **Support per-log bastion in Sigsum's ansible and deploy it**
    - Work by: elias
    - Review by: ln5 if needed
    - Expected outcome:
      - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/admin/ansible/-/issues/86
      - https://git.glasklar.is/glasklar/services/sigsum-logs/-/issues/70
      - https://git.glasklar.is/glasklar/services/sigsum-logs/-/issues/71
    - Estimated done: towards the end of February
  - **High availability witnessing operations**
    - Work and review by: elias, ln5, rgdd
    - Expected outcome:
      - Glasklar can operate a witness group with a 99% SLA
      - Associated documentation that can help other operators
      - (Tweaked from the last roadmap, now with a concrete SLA goal)
    - Estimated done: mid April
  - **Misc projects filippo is considering**
    - Add C2SP.org web interface (estimated done in Q1 or latest Q2)
    - Add [witnessing roaster][] in C2SP.org, likely help from rgdd or nisse?
    - Progress on tlog-proof in C2SP.org, likely help from rgdd or nisse?
    - Progress on tlog-policy in C2SP.org, likely help form rgdd or nisse?
    - Sign-if-logged in the context of CT for SCTs (USB armory)
    - Hardware-based protection for witness keys (USB armory)
    - Soon/later: progress on spicy tooling
    - Soon/later: more verifiable index work (possibly in age and/or sigsum)
  - **Misc projects florolf is considering**
    - Split-view related improvements in [sigmon][] (based on prior discussions
      on how a monitor should use witness cosignatures to get the same view)

As usual: support, bug fixing, and other maintenance is in scope and planned
separately when needed.

## What happens after mid April, 2026

To be decided, but we don't expect any major changes in high-level priorities.

A natural next TKey app after the planned log-signer is a witness-signer.  In
other words, it is likely such work might make it into the roadmap soon.

Something we're considering ramping up is progress on [sigsum/next][].  The
first step here will likely be to take Tessera for a test drive (POXIS backend)
with the current Sigsum leaf, then start hashing out what the next leaf should
be.  It seems more likely that this is a candidate activity after the summer.

For further hints on what might be selected as the main activities in the
future, refer to Sigsum's [issue boards][] and (sometimes "DRAFT:")
[milestones][].  Try filtering on the GitLab ["Future" tag][].  If you have
input on what you want to see work on, file and comment on issues or reach out
as you see fit.  Contact information can be found on <https://www.sigsum.org/>.

## Summary of progress since November, 2025

A few highlights:

  - Named policy work reached its first milestone of "done"
    - Updated getting started guide: https://www.sigsum.org/getting-started/
    - Trust policy maintenance: https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/policy-maintenance.md
    - TODO: add blog post link (to be added here latest this week)
  - The age encryption tool started using the `sigsum-generic` named policy
    - https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/blob/v1.3.1/SIGSUM.md
  - Demo and blog post on how to design a key server for the age encryption
    tool, e.g., including use of the recently launched witness-network.org
    - https://words.filippo.io/keyserver-tlog/
  - Demo and blog post about SSH certificate transparency using Sigsum
    - https://blog.n621.de/2026/01/ssh-certificate-transparency/
  - New releases of litewitness and litebastion that support per-log bastions
    - https://github.com/FiloSottile/torchwood/blob/v0.7.0/NEWS.md#v070
  - Corresponding per-log bastion changes landed in sigsum's ansible
    - No release yet, main is git-commit 80cd09cb95d3402c25433b83213b28ddd2e2af49
  - Trust-policy parsing and verification has landed in torchwood.  A few more
    improvements have also landed in litewitness, litebastion, and witnessctl.
    - https://github.com/FiloSottile/torchwood/blob/v0.9.0/NEWS.md#torchwood
  - A new core library is available for offline verification in C
    - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/core/sigsum-c
  - A specification for compiled trust policies is available
    - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/core/sigsum-c/-/blob/main/doc/quorum-bytecode.md?ref_type=heads
  - Another C library with Sigsum verification is available, see README for the
    current status and how it relates to core/sigsum-c and core/sigsum-go.
    - https://github.com/florolf/spic
  - Trust policy format has been slightly tightened up, see details:
    - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/core/sigsum-go/-/merge_requests/261
    - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/core/sigsum-go/-/issues/170
  - Drafty sigsum to tlog-tile mirroring is available for inspiration
    - https://github.com/florolf/sigmon/blob/master/doc/mirror.md
  - External code review by gb (sigsum-agent, litewitness, litebastion, sigsum-go offline verify, sigsum-c offline verify)
    - https://git.glasklar.is/nevun/tlog-code-review
    - TODO: wait for ack from gb before merge
  - The proposal on adding a backwards-compatible leaf context needs more
    discussion before possibly being moved forward.  The current vibe seems to
    be that it is a complexity that could become the cause of unintended usage.

We did not have enough cycles to:

  - Make a new release of Sigsum's ansible with per-log bastion support
    - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/admin/ansible/-/issues/86
  - Release version 1 of the TKey sign-if-logged app
    - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/apps/sign-if-logged (work in progress)
    - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/apps/tkey-sign-if-logged (work in progress)
  - Publish an introductory blog post for new witness operators, and to do
    witness operator reach out (e.g., to recruit people to witness-network.org)
  - Publish high-availability witnessing documentation / notes
    - Work in progress, rgdd and ln5 have only loosely sketched so far

The above activities continues in the upcoming roadmap.

We also did not have enough cycles to:

  - Default to a named policy during sigsum-key key generation
    - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/core/sigsum-go/-/issues/172
  - Page in an onboarding milestone
    - https://git.glasklar.is/groups/sigsum/-/milestones/22#tab-issues

The above activities are backlogged and not continued right now.

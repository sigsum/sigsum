Hello
	* rgdd
	* ln5

Status round
	* [rgdd] implemented open-ended shard interval
		* https://git.sigsum.org/sigsum/commit/?id=4ea13eb1ceee1610d9044965c1a90b6d5443518b
		* sigsum-log-go @ tag v0.3.2
	* [ln5] deployed v0.3.2 as new shard "glass-frog"
	* [ln5] made some progress on SSH signing format
		* it appears that ssh uses ed25519 without prehashing the ssh struct
		* ssh-keygen -Y only implements SHA512 for H(message), spec says SHA256 is supported
		* need: verify the above by signing with ssh-keygen, verify manually in python nacl

Decisions
	* None

Next steps
	* [rgdd] fix work packages
	* [ln5] SSH signing format (continued)
	* [ln5] sysadmin work, onboarding of new sysadmin

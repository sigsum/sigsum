# 2024-10-29

This document provides a sketch of the current roadmap and involved people.  We
will renew the roadmap towards the end of January, 2025.

## Summary of changes

The last roadmap was documented and decided here:

- https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/archive/2024-09-03-roadmap.md
- https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/archive/2024-09-03--meeting-minutes.md#decisions

The progress can be summarized as follows:

- A new log-go release ([v0.15.0][]).  Most notably it implements the
  interoperable [witness protocol][] we collaborate on in c2sp.org.  A new
  litewitness release is also available ([v0.2.1][]) that implements this.
- New ansible releases ([v1.1.0--v1.1.3][]).  Examples of added features include
  rate-limit configurations and YubiHSM-support using [sigsum-agent][].
- An early prototype for a [log-signer backed by a TKey][].
- We had three talks at the transparency-dev summit:
  - filippo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZXESulUuKA
  - nisse: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY_v7yNrl2A
  - rgdd: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mp23yQxYm2c
- Glasklar deployed a stable Sigsum log named [seasalp][].

[v0.15.0]: https://lists.sigsum.org/mailman3/hyperkitty/list/sigsum-announce@lists.sigsum.org/thread/MYBHRH3IHWU6FXIGDTWQWUR7AUM2KGF2/
[witness protocol]: https://c2sp.org/tlog-witness
[v0.2.1]: https://github.com/FiloSottile/litetlog/tree/v0.2.1
[sigsum-agent]: https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/core/key-mgmt/
[v1.1.0--v1.1.3]: https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/admin/ansible/-/blob/v1.1.3/docs/docsite/rst/CHANGELOG.rst
[log-signer backed by a TKey]: https://git.glasklar.is/nisse/tkey-log-signer
[seasalp]: https://seasalp.glasklar.is/

We did not have time to work on default/named policies.  We also did not have
time to work on deployment of a stable witness.  The upcoming roadmap
effectively backlogs the former and continues with work on the latter and more:
compared to the previous roadmap, we are now starting to make *some* progress on
the high-level priorities beyond deployment of Sigsum logs and witnesses.

## High-level priorities

1. Sigsum logs are operated with good business continuity
2. Witnesses are operated with good business continuity
3. Use-cases of Sigsum, including tooling that makes this easy
4. Monitoring
   - Of sigsum use-cases
   - Light-weight monitoring / verifiable log-backed maps
5. Release-candidate specification in c2sp.org are finalized
   - Witness API gets a roaster or similar defined
   - We have sufficient experience using the specs to be "done"

We will mainly work on (1)--(3) until the roadmap is renewed.

Support and bug fixes are in scope and planned separately when needed.

## People and activities

- filippo
  - Maintains c2sp.org specs
  - Maintains litebastion and litewitness
  - Will follow-up with potential witness operators and prioritize things that
    make the ecosystem grow.  May include baking a witness into sunlight.
  - Will explore log-backed maps which make monitoring cheap.  Outcomes could
    include a c2sp spec or age/sumdb/ct/sigsum prototypes.  rgdd as rubberduck.
  - In other words: filippo is working on high-level priorities 2 and 4.
- ln5
  - Maintains Sigsum's Ansible collection, poke him for updates
  - Responsible for log/witness operations, help from rgdd
  - Will work on documentation of what to expect from seasalp with rgdd
  - Will work on deploying a stable Glasklar witness with rgdd
  - In other words: ln5 is working on high-level priorities 1 and 2.
- nisse
  - Maintains Sigsum's core/ repositories
  - Will do a bit of maintenance and address some feedback (see milestone)
  - Will work on adding support for Sigsum in ST (key-usage transparency)
  - In other words: nisse is mainly working on high-level priority 3.
- rgdd
  - Maintains c2sp.org specs
  - Responsible for planning, coordinating, chairing, etc
  - Point of contact for those that want to operate logs and witnesses
  - Will work with ln5 on Glasklar's log and witness operations
  - Will take a stab at shared configuration for logs and witnesses.  Possible
    outcomes include formulating and agreeing on the problem we want to solve;
    evaluating some solution options; and getting some code to run for this.
    Exactly how this progresses depends on input from filippo/nisse/trustfab.
  - Will take a stab at a summary of what we would consider for a sigsum/v2.
    This will likely include poking a few people for feedback on this list.
  - In other words: rgdd is mainly working on high-level priorities 1 and 2.
    Writing down something about sigsum/v2 is meant as a quick side-project.

## Concrete milestones

nisse:
- https://git.glasklar.is/groups/sigsum/-/milestones/19#tab-issues
- https://git.glasklar.is/groups/system-transparency/-/milestones/25#tab-issues

ln5 and rgdd:
- https://git.glasklar.is/glasklar/services/sigsum-logs/-/milestones/2#tab-issues

There are no milestones for filippo's work.  He plans it from the above bullets.
Similarly the last two bullets of rgdd's activities have no concrete milestones.

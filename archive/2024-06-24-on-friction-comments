Adding a link to source repo for tools makes sense.

RE: trust policy and UX issue, we already have:
- https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/core/sigsum-go/-/issues/49
- https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/core/sigsum-go/-/issues/50

I've had this in the back of my mind for some time. TL;DR:
- I think we need to provide a good default policy that "just works".
- And I would like it to continue working even as the policy is updated.
- I think the policy either needs to live as part of our tools, or as part of a
  package that packages our tools.  So the root of trust is either of the two.
- I'd like the policy transitions to be verifiable.
- I'd like to be possible to replace and/or extend the policy somehow.  E.g.,
  "defaults are great, expect I really want this one additional witness in it".
  But maybe this is too complicated, and one should just support "replace".

RE: we need something that projects can link from READMEs to help end users
verify releases
- Agree.

RE: Monitoring...
- Agree, what's in the getting-started right now wrt. monitoring is not ready
  for "real use" yet.
- For context, when I put together the getting-started guide I just put
  everything we had into it, complete or not.  Just to show where we're at.

RE: wish the artifacts were shown since they are textual
- I think that's a good idea.  Similar to how we show the entire policy file for
  example and then explain it briefly.

RE: /etc/sigsum not a friendly path on macOS for users without root
- Hmm, yeah there's nothing in the tools that enforce this.  I put it here
  because it seemed nice to have it in a protected location basically.  But for
  an example this might not be the best, should probably be changed.  And as
  noted above, I hope we can provide a good default in one way or another.

RE: SSH agent and Ed25519 keys on hardware
- agent works, yes. I dont think we should do that in the getting started guide,
  but somehow mentioning this and linking something helpful makes sense
- tkey works, do you have one of those?
- IIRC it is possible to make it work with a yubikey too, by tunneling ssh-agent
  through gpg-agent.  I think I verified that this works at some point, and then
  I didn't take enough notes and never had time to go back to it.  If this
  works (to be verified again), I'd be interested to know how gpg agent
  interacts with the Ed25519 key. Maybe we can write something more sane to get
  rid of gpg-agent then.

RE: there's a lot of hashing going around. And terminology.
- Agree, there's room for improvement.  Thanks for all the thoughtful comments!
  I think the next step here is we take a pass to improve it.
- I also think a glossary is going to be *very helpful*, so we can also add
  links on some of the terms.  I have a WIP MR from long ago for glossary.

RE: passed multiple files to sigsum-submit
- Let's open issues and get this fixed

RE: each submission took exactly 30s, guide says 10
- Hmm, this sounds like a misconfiguration on the log server side

RE: key + policy in the same file
- Not sure, I think I'm leaning towards a good default policy

RE: silence is a good think
- I'd be +1 for adding the stderr print on success

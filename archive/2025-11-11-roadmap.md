# 2025-11-11

This document provides an overview of Sigsum's roadmap and people with standing
responsibilities.  A new roadmap will be decided at the end of January, 2026.

## High-level priorities

In roughly this order whenever possible:

  1. Sigsum logs are operated with good business continuity
  2. Witnesses are operated with good business continuity
  3. It is easy to use Sigsum
     - Wrt. integrating into something existing
     - Wrt. being a party that offline-verifies
     - Wrt. being a party that monitors
  4. Further development (broader and possibly experimental)

From these high-level priorities we define shorter-term activities.

## Main activities until the end of January, 2026

  - **Support sigsum leaves with signing contexts**
    - Work by: nisse
    - Review by: rgdd
    - Expected outcome:
      - Proposal on Sigsum leaf with context (backwards compatible)
      - Release sigsum v1.1.0 specification
      - Release corresponding log-go and sigsum-go implementations
    - Previous notes relating to this:
      - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/archive/2025-09-03-leaf-context-for-sigsum-v2.md
    - Expected done: November 18, 2025
  - **Support deployments with one bastion host per log**
    - Work and review by: rgdd, ln5
    - Expected outcome:
      - Stable sigsum logs have their own bastion hosts
      - Bastion host client that supports this in litewitness
      - Ansible and log-go/litewitness documentation updates
      - Witness getting started guide on www.sigsum.org, scoped for testing
      - Blog post with target audience: maybe become a witness operator?
    - Expected done: 25 November, 2025
  - **First supported version of the sigsum-c library**
    - Work and review by: nisse, rgdd
    - Expected outcome: <https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/issues/51>
    - Expected done: 9 December
  - **First supported version of the sign-if-logged TKey app**
    - Work by: nisse, rgdd, elias, mc/Tillitis
    - Expected outcome:
      - Upstreaming into TKey library (mc/Tillitis)
      - TKey device app targeting Bellatrix (nisse)
      - Associated host app (nisse)
      - sigsum-go compiled policy (elias)
      - TODO: replace this with an issue or milestone URL
    - Expected done: January 26, 2026
  - **Recommended trust policy for non-testing usage**
    - Work by: elias
    - Review by: nisse
    - Expected outcome:
      - Consider adding a default policy when generating keys (sigsum-key)
      - Update getting started guide (should target testing policy)
      - Document how logs and witnesses are selected (non-testing policy)
      - Release of sigsum-go that contains a non-testing policy
      - Blog post introducing named policies
    - Expected done: 18 November, 2025
  - **Experiment with Tessera-backed sigsum log**
    - Work by: ln5
    - Review by: n/a
    - Expected outcome:
      - Get Tessera running with a sigsum personality (current leaf)
      - Use POSIX backend, pipe clean wrt. appropriate replication

If time permits, Elias will page in his [onboarding milestone][].  In terms of
calendar time, this would happen after named and compiled trust policies.

Filippo and rgdd are also planning to do a bit of witness operator outreach.

Filippo will also continue exploring [verifiable indexes][] together with Martin
Hutchinson, which will likely culminate in some kind of prototype for age key
transparency, Certificate Transparency, Go's sumDB, Sigsum, or similar.

As usual: support, bug fixing, and other maintenance is in scope and planned
separately when needed.

## What happens after October, 2025

To be decided, but we don't expect any major changes in high-level priorities.

For hints on what might be selected as the main activities in the future, refer
to Sigsum's [issue boards][] and (sometimes "DRAFT:") [milestones][].  You can
try filtering on the GitLab ["Future" tag][].  If you have input on what you
want to see work on, file and comment on issues or reach out as you see fit.

    - <https://git.glasklar.is/nisse/sigsum-c>
  - Tor consensus transparency prototype is available.
    - Directory authority patch: TODO: URL for Roger's patch.
    - Monitor: <https://metrics.torproject.org/collector.html>
    - Current status: one directory authority is submitting consensus docs
      to barreleye, and a monitor is following barreleye and downloading
      consensus documents from the archive as they appear
      \[[tpo:collector](https://collector.torproject.org/),
      [tpo:metrics](https://metrics.torproject.org/collector.html)\].
    - TODO: can ln5 make a very short README we can link instead?
  - [Tillitis](https://www.tillitis.se/) started operating a stable witness.
    - <https://github.com/tillitis/tillitis.se-tillitis-witness-1/blob/main/about.md>
  - We had attended the [Transparency.dev
    summit](https://transparency.dev/summit2025/schedule/)
    - TODO: add link to filippo's talk
    - TODO: add link to rgdd's talk
    - TODO: add link to kfs' talk
    - TODO: add link to florolf's lightning talk
    - TODO: add link to ln5's lightning talk

We did not have enough cycles to:

  - Prototype a TKey witness signer, see however the related TKey log signer
    app.  More prototyping of log/witness signer apps are backlogged for now.
  - Prepare a named policy that is recommended for non-testing usage.  This work
    continues in the upcoming roadmap.
  - Do any significant progress on the [onboarding milestone][].  Elias will
    continue this if time permits after completing named and compiled policies.
  - Write or implement anything with regard to one bastion host per log.  This
    work continues in the upcoming roadmap (so far we've only been sketching).
  - Get a first iteration of a witness getting-started guide ready.  This work
    continues in the upcoming roadmap.  The current status is linked below.

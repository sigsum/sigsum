# 2025-11-11

This document provides an overview of Sigsum's roadmap and people with standing
responsibilities.  A new roadmap will be decided towards the end of January,
2026.

## High-level priorities

In roughly this order whenever possible:

  1. Sigsum logs are operated with good business continuity
  2. Witnesses are operated with good business continuity
  3. It is easy to use Sigsum
     - Wrt. integrating into something existing
     - Wrt. being a party that offline-verifies
     - Wrt. being a party that monitors
  4. Further development (broader and possibly experimental)

From these high-level priorities we define shorter-term activities.

## Main activities until the middle of January, 2026

  - **Support sigsum leaves with signing contexts**
    - Work by: nisse
    - Review by: rgdd
    - Expected outcome:
      - Proposal on sigsum leaf with context (backwards compatible)
      - Release sigsum v1.1.0 specification
      - Release corresponding log-go and sigsum-go implementations
    - Previous notes relating to this:
      - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/archive/2025-09-03-leaf-context-for-sigsum-v2.md
    - Estimated done: November 18, 2025
  - **Recommended trust policy for non-testing usage**
    - Work by: elias
    - Review by: nisse
    - Expected outcome:
      - Consider adding a default policy when generating keys (sigsum-key)
      - Update getting started guide (should target testing policy)
      - Document how logs and witnesses are selected (non-testing policy)
      - Release of sigsum-go that contains a non-testing policy
      - Blog post introducing named policies
    - Expected done: 18 November, 2025
  - **Support deployments with one bastion host per log**
    - Work and review by: rgdd, ln5
    - Expected outcome:
      - Stable sigsum logs have their own bastion hosts
      - Bastion host client that supports this in litewitness
      - Ansible and log-go/litewitness documentation updates
      - Witness getting started guide on www.sigsum.org, scoped for testing
      - Blog post with target audience: maybe become a witness operator?
    - Estimated done: 2 December, 2025
  - **First supported version of the sigsum-c library**
    - Work and review by: nisse, rgdd
    - Expected outcome: <https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/issues/51>
    - Estimated done: 9 December
  - **First supported version of the sign-if-logged TKey app**
    - Work and review by: nisse, elias, mc/Tillitis; rgdd also available for review
    - Expected outcome: https://git.glasklar.is/groups/sigsum/-/milestones/24#tab-issues
    - Estimated done: January 13, 2026
  - **Experiment with Tessera-backed sigsum log**
    - Work by: ln5
    - Rubberduck: rgdd
    - Expected outcome:
      - Get Tessera running with a sigsum personality (current leaf)
      - Use POSIX backend, pipe clean wrt. appropriate replication
      - Definition of "done" here is a bit fuzzy -- the goal is to understand
        the current status of Tessera (especially in relation to Sigsum).
    - Estimated done: January 13

If time permits, Elias will page in his [onboarding milestone][].  In terms of
calendar time, this would happen after "Recommended trust policy for non-testing
usage" and supporting compiled policy-format in sigsum-go (part of TKey work).

Filippo and rgdd are also planning to do a bit of witness operator outreach.

Filippo will also continue exploring [verifiable indexes][] together with Martin
Hutchinson, which will likely culminate in some kind of prototype for age key
transparency, Certificate Transparency, Go's sumDB, Sigsum, or similar.

As usual: support, bug fixing, and other maintenance is in scope and planned
separately when needed.

## What happens after January, 2026

To be decided, but we don't expect any major changes in high-level priorities.

Something we're considering ramping up is progress on [sigsum/next][].  This is
part of why it is timely to explore leaf context and Tessera in this roadmap.
This is especially interesting if it could lead to more log interoperability.

For further hints on what might be selected as the main activities in the
future, refer to Sigsum's [issue boards][] and (sometimes "DRAFT:")
[milestones][].  Try filtering on the GitLab ["Future" tag][].  If you have
input on what you want to see work on, file and comment on issues or reach out
as you see fit.  Contact information can be found on <https://www.sigsum.org/>.

We did not have enough cycles to:

  - Write or implement anything with regard to one bastion host per log.  This
    work continues in the upcoming roadmap (so far we've only been sketching).
  - Get a first iteration of a witness getting-started guide ready.  This work
    continues in the upcoming roadmap.  The current status is linked below.
    - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/commit/44d6bde77efca6e08102fc398fc8f1b14dc28458
  - Prepare a named policy that is recommended for non-testing usage.  This work
    continues in the upcoming roadmap.
  - Do any significant progress on our [onboarding milestone][].  Elias will
    continue on this if time permits towards the end of the upcoming roadmap.
  - Prototype a TKey witness signer, see however the related TKey log signer
    app.  More prototyping of log/witness signer apps are backlogged for now.

	* [rgdd] a claimant model example (warning: sketch)
		* bring sigsum's witnessing to a different log ecosystem
		* https://git.sigsum.org/sigsum/tree/archive/2021-10-19-cm-example-ct-wit?id=28425af42f7e2a4bb6934d61d82f393b337f01da

Discuss
	* Revisit milestones
		* September, October: checked at the same time
		* November: was "poc use-case"
			* Decision: keep, also fix a user-friendly example with tooling
		* Decision: dog food sharding the coming months
	* Enumerate and prioritize our backlog
		* sigsum (documentation, design)
			* Few open design details to be considered, see archive 2021-10-05
			* Especially signature would be good to revisit
			* Decision: defer, see if we get some other feedback to consider as well
		* sigsum-lib-go (tooling)
			* Library (rgdd)
			* Commands (rgdd)
		* sigsum-log-go
			* rate limits (Decision: defer)
			* read-only mode (rgdd)
			* server config (Decision: defer)
			* metrics (Decision: defer)
			* experimental checkpoint endpoint (rgdd)
			* hsm support (Decision: defer)
			* "run locally documentation" (Decision: defer, same time as server config)
		* sigsum-witness-py (ln5)
			* shard rotation?
			* error handling
			* metrics
			* hsm (Decision: defer)
		* research
			* formal security proof (rohonk)
		* Operations (Decision: defer)
			* Log database
			* Alerts, also in irc/matrix? (maybe ln5)
			* Multi-instance tree head manager, required if >1 log FEs
		* Project
			* License legality: Copyright by whom? What CLA? (ln5)
			* other docs?
				* weekly-meet.md?
			* mailing list - dmarc etc. (ln5)
		* Dog fooding (use-cases)
			* ST (Decision: yes, after sigsum-lib-go)
			* SRI
			* Witness CT logs
			* Map mode for sigsum
			* A toy that is non-cs? (Decision: yes, after sigsum-lib-go)
			* Mailing list transparency?

Next steps
	* [rgdd] sigsum-lib-go, read-only mode, and experimental checkpoint endpoint
	* [ln5] sigsum-witness-py, enhanced mailing list configuration, and CLA

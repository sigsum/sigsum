## Hello

- rgdd
- nisse
- ln5

## Status round

- rgdd: rename the yubihsm repo to key-mgmt with linus and nisse, move the docs
  around a bit so that it made sense again. And setup the Go metadata tag for
  it.
- nisse: Added socket-activation to yubihsm-agent, nothing more planned here
  unless linus run into any issues when giving it a go

## Decisions

- None

## Next steps

- rgdd: start prepping the updated roadmap (again), rubber duck if anyone needs
  my input
- nisse: tag yubihsm-agent, address feedback from linus if any
- ln5: give the yubihsm-agent things a go, integrate it with systemd

## Other

- None

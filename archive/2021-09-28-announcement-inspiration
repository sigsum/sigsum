Summary
	* Announce via mailing list
		* It happens in our community
		* It makes it easy to respond
		* It makes it easy to forward
		* We can keep our website minimal for now (landing page)
	* Announcements seem to be relatively short
		* Max 500 words is probably a good rule of thumb
		* Shorter if you have a few polished links to reference
	* Possible points to make, also based on what we discussed before
		* What type of project are we
		* What is the project about
		* What is the purpose of project announcement
		* What is the timeline leading up to announcement
		* What is the current project status
		* What are the next steps
		* Who is involved, people and funders
		* Relevant links to help the reader navigate sigsum
		* (Get feedback from a communicator)

Other things to keep in mind
	* Double check that what we are linking is in good enough shape
		* E.g., small TODOs in sigsum-log-go README.md (fix links)
	* We should think about what questions people might have in response to announcement
		* Perhaps it would be a good idea to give design.md FAQ some love
	* Try to avoid too much detail, we can make sigsum blog posts at a later stage
	* The fact that we are aware of sigstore should probably be clear
		* Let people ask, that's fine

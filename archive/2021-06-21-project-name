Background
	* ST != ST Logging
	* This distincion is not evident for a newcomer.
	* The same log personality is applicable for other use-cases than ST.
	* We need a better name in order to minimize confusion

Parameters to keep in mind
1. What is it that we are trying to abbreviate. Is it a good full name?
2. Is the abbreviation easy and convenient to use in documentation?
3. Is the abbreviation easy to prunounce, work into to sentences, etc.?
4. Is the abbreviation easily confused with something else?

What are we providing - full names and possible abbreviations?
	* Something sensible that can replace the CT piggyback hack, where a checksum is inserted into a signed certificate.
	* Checksum Logging, Checksum Transparency
		* CL, CT
		* checksumlog, checksumtrans
		* sumlog, sumtrans
		* checklog, checktrans
	* Signature Logging, Signature Transparency
		* SL, ST
		* siglog, sigtrans
		* sigl
	* Signed Checksum Logging, Signed Checksum Transparency
		* SCL, SCT
		* sigsum
			* sigsumlog, sigsum-log, sigsuml
			* sigsumtrans, sigsum-trans, sigsumt
		* sigcheck
			* sigchecklog, sigcheck-log
			* sigchecktrans, sigcheck-trans

	* The start of three words feels too verbose for an abbreaviation to be useful.
	* It might be good if the short version does not contain "log".  It makes the abbreaviation more difficult to use in speach and text.
		* "A siglog log", "siglog logging", etc.
		* Cf. "a sigtrans log", "sigtrans logging", etc.
	* Checksum Logging, Checksum Transparency
		* I am not that worried about someone starting to say "CT" (or mix it up).
		* I am worried about confusion with Go's checksum database.
			* "Why do we need another checksum database".  Well, things are signed too.
		* I don't like any of the proposed abbreviations.  Not sure why, subjective.
	* Signature Logging, Signature Transparency
		* If we talk about System Transparency and abbreaviate it ST, I think it is probable that an unfamiliar reader will mix up the meaning of "S".
		* Sigstore brands Rekor as "Signature Transparency".
			* Using the same full name is not helpful for anyone. Big no-go for me.
			* To be fair Rekor is more about signature transparency than we are. E.g., there are many signature schemes and formats that we will never support.
	* Signed Checksum Logging, Signed Checksum Transparency
		* I like this because it is descriptive and distinct
			* It is consistent with how we talk about the log in text and speach
			* No other tlog project uses the exact same wordings (as far as I know anyway)
		* An obvious abbreaviation is SCT.  That could lead to confusion.
			* I think most tlog people would know that "SCT" is not a good idea though.
			* The short abbreaviation has to be introduced clearly, and be convenient. If that is the case, using SCT as an abbreaviation would not cross your mind?
		* I tried playing with "sigsum" below.
			* "Sigsum - a free and open source project that brings transparency to signed checksums".
			* Repos
				* sigsum-server-go / sigsum-log-go
				* ...
			* irc channel, or channels if we start thinking ahead
				* #sigsum
				* #sigsum-dev
				* #sigsum-meet
				* #sigsum-{log,server}
				* #sigsum-witness
				* ...
			* Website

# Sigsum Logging
_Sigsum_ logging brings transparency to **sig**ned check**sum**s.  What a checksum represents is up to you.  For example, it could be the cryptographic hash of
a provenance metadata file](https://security.googleblog.com/2021/06/introducing-slsa-end-to-end-framework.html), a [Firefox binary](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Binary_Transparency), or a text document.

Sigsum logging can be used to:
1. Discover which checksum signatures were produced by what secret signing keys.
2. Be sure that everyone observes the same signed checksums.

	* Decision: "Signed Checksum Logging" (full version)
	* Decision: "sigsum" (short version, what we use to brand the project)
		* "A sigsum log, "sigsum logging", etc.
	* Decision: sigsum.org
		* Con: we don't get domain locking as with .se
			* Doesn't affect security of logs though.
		* Pro: less risk of being perceived as a local project in Sweden

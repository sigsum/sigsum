Q: how sigsum project different than ct from security / architecture point of view

CT
	* SCTS, promises of public logging
	* Centrally trust the logs because it is difficult to audit in practise
		* Privacy
		* Complexity

Sigsum
	* No SCTs, you need to fetch an inclusion proof that references a cosigned tree head
	* Decentralized/distributed trust, assumption is an honest majority for witnesses
	* A pretty opinionated gossip-audit model, much emphasis on simple and minimalistic

Q: why no cryptographic agility / what is the motivation?
	* Don't let people use old bad choices like rsa, legacy tools, etc.
	* Makes exchanged protocol messages simpler (e.g., no negotiation)
	* Makes supporting sigsum protocol easier (you need one primitive, not many)
	* If a primitive breaks -> roll up protocol version

Q: Elaborate about "the right data"?
	* Suppose you downloaded Tor Browser
	* Signature is valid
	* Now what?
	* You kind of have to trust that the signer signed the right data
	* What if the signer was coereced to sign a back-doored version?
	* What if the signing key was stolen? How would a signer even detect that?
	* Sigsum logs add discoverability into signing operations
	* Anyone can detect what has been signed by monitoring sigsum logs
	* "Oh, there is this signature that doesn't correspond to any Tor Browser Bundle"
	* "Tor Project, what is that? Please look into this issue and explain"
	* This type of transparency is difficult without a log that adds discoverability

Q: What crypto primitives are supported
	* Ed25519 (signify, minisign, etc.)
	* SHA256
	* (Remark: we are thinking about Ed25519ph and SHA512/256)

Q: At what part Rohon comes in?
	* Model system formally, requires notation
	* Think about how security proof goes (properties, assumptions, argument)

Some links

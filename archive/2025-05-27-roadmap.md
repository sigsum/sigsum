# 2025-05-27

This document provides an overview of Sigsum's roadmap and people with standing
responsibilities.  A new roadmap will be decided around the end of August, 2025.

## High-level priorities

In roughly this order whenever possible:

  1. Sigsum logs are operated with good business continuity
  2. Witnesses are operated with good business continuity
  3. It is easy to use Sigsum
     - Wrt. integrating into something existing
     - Wrt. being a party that offline-verifies
     - Wrt. being a party that monitors
  4. Further development (broader and possibly experimental)

From these high-level priorities we define shorter-term activities.

## Main activities until the end of August, 2025

The main activities are:

  - **Take a stab at metrics and test+document log failover**
    - https://git.glasklar.is/groups/sigsum/-/milestones/21#tab-issues
    - Relates to: priority (1)
    - Work by: elias, ln5
    - Review by: nisse for core/ changes
    - Expected done: before next roadmap renewal
  - **Get started with shared witness configuration.**
    - Relates to: priorities (1), (2), (4)
    - Work by: rgdd, trust fabric, filippo
    - Expected outcome: sync and polish based on the [initial design doc][] to
      get a working repository/project up and running.
    - Expected done: exact timeline depends on all involved parties.  Possibly
      before the summer holidays, otherwise before the transparency-dev summit?
  - **Look into ways of getting rid of trust-policy [EOF blurbs][]**.
    - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/core/sigsum-go/-/issues/51
    - Relates to: priority (3)
    - Work and review by: elias, nisse (filippo is available for design review)
    - Expected outcome: a UX where the user doesn't have to copy-paste an EOF
      blurb, so something in the direction of a named policy.  See the linked
      issue for some of the ideas that should be considered.  It is likely that
      one part of the solution will be for Sigsum to maintain a trust policy.
    - Expected done: before next roadmap renewal
  - **Improvements of sigsum-monitor and the sigsum-go monitoring library.**
    - Relates to: priority (3)
    - Work by: rgdd
    - Review by: nisse
    - Expected outcome: non-continuous running mode and verification of witness
      cosignatures.  Possibly a few other minor improvements.
    - Expected done: before the summer holidays
  - **Minor improvements and fixes in core/.**
    - https://git.glasklar.is/groups/sigsum/-/milestones/22#tab-issues
    - Relates to: onboarding, maintenance
    - Work by: elias
    - Review by: nisse (or rgdd if nisse is on vacation)
    - Expected done: before the next roadmap renewal

Support, bug fixing, and other maintenance is in scope and planned separately
when needed.

## What happens after August, 2025

To be decided, but we don't expect any major changes in high-level priorities.

[torchwood]: https://github.com/FiloSottile/torchwood

We did not have enough cycles to:

  - Look into ways of getting rid of trust policy EOF blurbs.  This work will be
    picked up by elias and nisse in the upcoming roadmap.
  - Contribute improvements to the Sigsum monitor library.  This work will be
    continued by nisse and rgdd in the upcoming roadmap.
  - Complete "Take a stab at metrics and test+document log failover".  Elias and
    ln5 have worked on related infrastructure needs that were prerequisites, and
    will continue with this in the upcoming roadmap.

    - Meet: https://meet.glasklar.is/sigsum
    - Chair: nisse

    - Status round
    - Decisions
    - Next steps
    - Other (after the meet if time permits)

## Hello

    - nisse
    - filippo

## Status round

    - gregoire: https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/core/sigsum-go/-/tree/gregoire/note
        - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/merge_requests/81
    - nisse: filippo's patch for keyfiles with multiple submit public
      keys has been merged. I think it makes sense to keep a distinction
      between single-pubkey files, and files that may contain a list of
      keys.
    - nisse: Back from vacation, will plan more next week.
    - filippo: C2SP tooling improvements https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/pull/93
    - filippo: doc on "populous reputational units" like Aromred Witness
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iKT8XD55iA3uJP4EssZwRUDwI7f5GUv6ZzBw-OB7xd0/edit

## Decisions

    - Decided: Cancel weekly next week, due to glasklar meetup.
        - Hence next Sigsum weekly is 2024-09-03 (this collides with
          Open Source Firmware Conference, but hopefully some people can
          attend nonetheless).

## Next steps

    - filippo: update age instructions to use new sigsum-verify key list
    - filippo: post review comments on !81

## Other

    - should we bridge transparency-dev Slack and #sigsum Matrix room?

    - fyi: progress on tile-based logs by the trustfabric folks /rgdd

# 2024-09-03

This document provides a sketch of the current roadmap and involved people.

## Summary of changes

The last roadmap was documented and decided here:

- https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/archive/2024-06-04-roadmap.md?ref_type=heads
- https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/archive/2024-06-04--meeting-minutes.md?ref_type=heads#decisions

The progress can be summarized as follows:

- [Dogfooding Sigsum on age releases](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age?tab=readme-ov-file#verifying-the-release-signatures)
- [Release-candidate tags for our specs in C2SP](https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/issues/97#issuecomment-2315900369)
- Filippo also made progress on sunlight and tiled logs

In the upcoming roadmap, there will be no specification work.  Focus is shifted
towards implementing the release-candidate specifications, doing additional
dogfooding, and deploying our software with better continuity than "prototype".

## Roadmap

The current priorities are as follows:

1. Implement specifications that get us witness interoperability
   - https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/tlog-witness/v0.1.0/tlog-witness.md
   - https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/tlog-cosignature/v1.0.0-rc.1/tlog-cosignature.md
2. Sigsum logs are operated with good business continuity
3. Witnesses are operated with good business continuity
4. Use-cases of Sigsum (including tooling that makes this easy)
5. Specification work
   - Release candidate specifications are released
   - Witness API is finalized with a roaster and gets a release-candidate tag
6. Monitoring for Sigsum use-cases

We will mainly focus on (1)--(2) until the transparency-dev summit, and make
best-effort progress on (3)--(4).  We will likely iterate more on (2)--(4) when
renewing the roadmap next time; and then also take a stab at (5).

Support and bug fixes are in scope and planned separately when needed.

## Concrete milestones

Nisse and Filippo plan their own work from the above bullets.  There are no
milestones right now, but they may appear in the [milestone tab][] later.

There is a milestone for tracking our deployment of a stable Sigsum log:

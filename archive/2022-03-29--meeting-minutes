		* https://git.sigsum.org/sigsum/tree/archive/2022-03-29-no-arbitrary-bytes-notes
	* [rgdd] started work on automated integration test
		* sigum-log-go:rgdd/integration, starts-up, check for HTTP 200 OK, close down
		* sigsum-tools-go:rgdd/sigsum-debug, should eventually replace sigsum-log-go/cmd/tmp
	* [rgdd] fixed new hugo template with our font, colors, and logo
		* some content changes too, thank you ln5 for feedback
		* (updated landing-page text and added an about text, the rest is mostly the same)
		* defer any focus on further text updates until ~later
	* [rgdd] added draft on a basic leveled logger
		* sigsum-lib-go:rgdd/log
		* a wrapper around the standard Go library log package
		* basically a more minimal alternative compared to otherwise popular choices
			* https://github.com/golang/glog
			* https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus
	* [rgdd] start sketching on how to clean-up sigsum repo structure
		* https://pad.sigsum.org/p/df53-ec47-ee23-be59 (active pad, don't persist)
	* [ln5] merged and published the new web site
	* [ln5] merged sigsum-lib-go stuff from rgdd
	* [ln5] finished SSHSIG signing in log, tooling and witness
	* [Anwesha] still working on a new apache2 role, role is more generic now
		* tried deploy flow, had to revert due to errors
		* good learning experience / exercise

Decisions
	* Decision: new meet time 1100 UTC to follow the recent CET -> CEST change

Next steps
	* [rgdd] merge integration stuff with "feature parity" compared to manual tests
	* [rgdd] fix http status 405 (see sigsum-log-go issues)
	* [rgdd] review and merge the sshsig stuff in sigsum-tools-go
	* [ln5] last things on log v0, then deploy new poc instance
	* [ln5] check sigsum branch assests, merge and deploy
	* [Anwesha] continue working on new apache2 role
	* [Anwesha] Set the process for testing (before we deploy on production)
	* [Anwesha] basic understanding of monitoring
	* [Anwesha] trying checkmk

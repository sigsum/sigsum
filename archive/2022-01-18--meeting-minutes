Hello
	* rgdd
	* ln5

Status round
	* [rgdd] brought decided proposals into primary documentation
		* branch rgdd/proposals in sigsum repo
		* [x] get-* endpoint proposal
		* [x] domain hint proposal
		* [x] add-leaf endpoint proposal
		* [x] remove arbitrary bytes proposal
			* Note: checksum now refers to a cryptographic hash which has a preimage
		* [x] tree-head endpoint proposal
			* Reflections: https://git.sigsum.org/sigsum/tree/archive/2022-01-18-tree-head-endpoint-observations
		* [x] ssh signing format proposal
			* Note: did not update example values (added todo note and linked proposal)
		* [x] open-ended shard-interval
		* feedback/review wanted before merging
		* added an issue to track implementation of the above
			* https://git.sigsum.org/sigsum-log-go/tree/issues/implement-decided-proposals.md
	* [rgdd, ln5] started sketching on what www.sigsum.org might be eventually
		* https://git.sigsum.org/sigsum/tree/archive/2022-01-18-future-website-sketch
	* [rgdd] start using the terminology "author" and "reader" proposal
		* https://git.sigsum.org/sigsum/tree/doc/proposals/2022-01-author-reader-terminology
	* [rgdd] redefine "base URL" as "log URL" proposal
		* https://git.sigsum.org/sigsum/tree/doc/proposals/2022-01-proposal-log-url
	* [ln5, rgdd] continued work on logotype

Decisions
	* Decision? start using terminology "author" and "reader"
		* No, proposal needs more work
		* Author seems like a good abstraction definition
		* Reader seems less good
	* Decision: redefine "base URL" as "log URL"

Next steps
	* [rgdd] tree-head endpoint implementation, think about replacement for "reader"
	* [ln5] log v0 implementation updates, email list improvements, database redundancy

Other useful links
	* Tor documentation about git integrity, including signing and mentions of tlogs

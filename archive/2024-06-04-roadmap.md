## Roadmap

The current priorities are as follows:

1. Progress on specifications
2. Sigsum logs are operated with good business continuity
3. Witnesses are operated with good business continuity
4. Use-cases of Sigsum
5. Monitoring for Sigsum use-cases

Until July 15, 2024, we will mainly work on the first two priorities. We will
also be doing a few documentation improvements if time permits.

Support and bug fixes are in scope and planned separately when needed. When
revisiting the roadmap next time, we will consider if we are able to take on
more and thus make progress on priorities (3), (4), and (5) as well.

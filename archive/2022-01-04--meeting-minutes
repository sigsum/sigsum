Decisions
	* Decision: adopt remove arbitrary bytes proposal
	* Decision: adopt change get-* endpoints that use HTTP post proposal

			* rgdd will fix before persisting proposal
	* Decision: adopt change add-leaf endpoint proposal
		* proposal text needs a minor update due to the get-tree-head-endpoint proposal
			* rgdd will fix before persisting proposal
	* Decision: change tree-head endpoints proposal
		* proposal endpoints need name, but does not need to be decided right now

Next steps

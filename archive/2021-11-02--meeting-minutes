	* Hello
	* Status round
	* Discuss
	* Next steps

Hello
	* rgdd
	* ln5
	* rohonk

Status round
	* [rgdd] making progress on sigsum-lib-go (ascii, hex, types)
	* [ln5] started running barreleye-fish shard
	* [rohon] initial work on security proof and parties that interact

Discuss
	* Use-case: mailing list transparency (ln5)
	* A reflection about our ASCII parser
		* Deserialization would be less error-prone with one list-item per line?
		* List-item with multiple things could have same parser, different delim characters
		* Decision: see what the syntax for this nested key-value format would look like

Next steps
	* See last week's TODOs which are still in progress

Status round
	* Slow week, nothing in particular to report right now

Discuss
	* Sharding
		* Time to start next shard, ln5 will set it up tomorrow
			* new public key
			* copy witness keys from the previous shard
			* kill shard that is currently running after it is done
				* use read-only mode in second shard
		* We should start working on a "best operators practise" document
			* "this is what you should think about when sharding"
			* "this amount of disk and ram is recommended"
			* "this is how you should manage keys"
			* etc.
	* Recommended hardware requirements for sigsum-log-go?
		* (Context: we were asked by an interested log operator.)
		* RAM?
		* Disk? When are things written to disk, and how often?
		* Cores? Does it scale automatically with many cores?
		* Cost per query, and does it change during a stress test?
		* "How much performance can you get out of a single instance?"
		* Decision: rgdd will look into this in November.

Next steps
	* See next steps from last week

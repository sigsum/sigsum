Hello
	* rgdd
	* ln5

Status round
	* [ln5] draft on SSH signature format idea
		* https://git.sigsum.org/sigsum/tree/doc/proposals/2021-11-ssh-signature-format.mdx

Decisions
	* Decision? start using SSH signature format
		* [rgdd] "yes but not yet", needs a bit more work:
			* ssh tooling actually signs a hash of "the struct", not the struct itself
				* 1) document this
				* 2) specify that sigsum stores _this hash_ in the leaf; not hash of checksum
				* 3) s/checksum_hash/signed_hash/g
				* 4) with signed_hash in leaf -> don't need shard hint to be stored by log?
			* finish tooling for signing and key generation and key format conversion
				* 1) to verify that everything is working as expected
				* 2) that tooling is good to have anyway
			* suggestion: v0:tree_leaf:<shard_hint>@sigsum.org looks better?
				* no, abort this suggestion; tooling output looks better as is
				* "this is a tree leaf; and the tree leaf version is 0"

Next steps
	* [ln5] finish tooling for signing, and updating of the signing change proposal
	* [ln5] sysadmin stuff
	* [rgdd] implement open-ended shard interval and fix work packages

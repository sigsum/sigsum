Feedback about our planning from ln5:

  - Overview a bit rushed, but I prefer that over it being dragged out
  - Aim to always refer to line numbers in the pad when making references, and
    sharing screen would be helpful.
  - Make more explicit that the linked milestones under the decision bullet
    refer to the enumeration in the roadmap pad, even better if they are not
    named "1", "2", ...
  - Motivate 8 weeks period?  [We try that now because we don't think it should
    be lower, probably higher.  But let's start somewhere and adjust
    accordingly.]

Feedback about our retrospective from ln5:

  - Productive, not too long
  - Rotate who gets to start on each question.  The first person has more things
    to say, and pretty much everything has been said when reaching the last
    person.
  - Make clear that it's ok to say pass or n/a to me etc
  - Last question is something to think about until next time

rgdd will persist this pad and the used retrospective questions.

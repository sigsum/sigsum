Written by rgdd based on status quo (to help onboarding more chairs).

Sigsum chair pointers:

- Remind people that the meet is happening sometime before noon, basically post
  the meet pad and let folks know they're welcome.
- If there are decisions queued up, please also remind people to take a look
  before the meet by mentioning that there are queued up decisions.
- Greet people that show up, take charge of the social if needed. This is the
  "hello" section that we're doing while people are dropping in. If there are
  new people, ensure there are introductions and explain the meet structure.
- Get yourself a secretary if you don't want to take notes yourself. The
  secretary will also persist the meeting minutes and create the next meet pad.
  If the secretary doesn't have push access they can create an MR instead.
- Get the meet going with status round when most expected people arrived (or
  call it if people are too late). Give everyone a chance to report at the
  status round. Ideally each report item is short ish, and any lengthier
  discussions are post poned to the other section. If something drags for too
  long, move the meet along depending on what else is on the agenda.
- In the status round: the idea is each participant reports on what they have
  been up to in sigsum/tlog land the past week (or since they last joined). It's
  of course okay to say "PASS" and just listen in on the meeting!
- Let people who proposed decisions pitch them, ask people for opinions if the
  room is quiet. Read the room -- is there a strong enough consensus? The rule
  of thumb is to defer decisions if it isn't mostly a formality to have the
  decision passed. Work on the proposal should be done before the meet. And we
  defer decisions if new information against the decision is raised (unless it
  can clearly and quickly be agreed the new information doesn't change the
  decision, even though the information maybe should have been considered). The
  chair doesn't do the decision, but they call it on "enough" consensus. If
  someone thinks there isn't enough consensus, or that there are still parts of
  the proposal that benefits from more discussion -> that's a warning sign.
- As for who's voice weights the most -> it's the ones who have read the
  proposal and are actively contributing to the project. Do stuff = get power.
- But remember we should treat all reasonable input as important to address
  regardless who it's from, and aim to always clarify what we decide and why.
- As for what needs a decision, the rule of thumb here is we decide on things
  relating to specs and processes. And other smaller formalitets and things we
  want to be clear, like if we're cancelling meets and so forth. A proposal is
  essentially a tool to ensure we're thinking important decisions through.
- Let everyone report next steps. Focus here is on "what you'll be doing until
  next week". And to resolve blockers, e.g., "hey I need $foo from you, any
  chance you can help out" etc. Preferrably people then go on to do the work,
  and report about it (or lack thereof) in the status round on the next weekly.
- Other section: check what's queued up, find a sequence of what to talk about
  based on how much time is left. Sometimes things need to be deferred, and
  sometimes it might even be worthwhile to break out. If new people are in the
  meeting and they want to ask questions or get feedback -> prioritize that.
- End the meeting on time (or end it early if we're out of agenda topics).

We collectively ensure the next meet gets an appropriate chair via IRC/Matrix
after the meet, and rgdd is ultimately responsible for ensuring this happens but
please help out if you see that something is falling through the cracks.

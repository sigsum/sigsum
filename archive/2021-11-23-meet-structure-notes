Some notes about sigsum's weekly jitsi meets (with proposed changes)

TL;DR
---
	* Background
		* The status round part is often enough for micro discussions
		* Longer discussions tend to bloat the meeting for all participants
		* Sometimes we don't get around to all decisions because we run out of time
	* Idea
		* s/Discuss/Decisions
		* Timebox meet to 50 minutes, hopefully less with the above
		* If anyone wants to discuss something in more detail:
			* Do it immeaditely after the meet if time
			* Else schedule a separate meet, take notes, and make it a status item next week
			* (Sometimes discussion is more appropriate on irc, i.e., jitsi not required)
			* Decision is automatically deferred until next week, if a decision is needed.
				* "We should have done the work before the meet to take a decision today"
		* See below for proposed meet pad template and notes
	* When we decided on a new meet structure, let's clean this up as e.g. "doc/meet.md"

Meet lifecycle
---
0. House keeping
	* Next meet pad is available at https://pad.sigsum.org/p/sigsum-YYYYMMDD
		* Date refers to the date of the meeting, usually every Tuesday
	* After the meet, the chair will:
		* Clean-up meet pad if it is too cluttered
		* Persist linked pads that are no longer believed to be active
		* Persist the resulting meet pad and post link in irc
		* Initialize next week's meet pad and post link in irc
		* (Archive link: https://git.sigsum.org/sigsum/tree/archive)

1. If you plan to attend, put your name into the "Hello" part of the agenda.  Most of
us use irc/matrix nicknames.  You can also add your nickname when you are showing up.

2. If you have anything to report, please create a report item in the "Status round"
section in advance.  These reports should be kept short and will most likely contain
either a link to learn more or a few talking points that make minutes more useful.
	* Examples
	* [alice] sketched on a new meeting structure as discussed last meet
		* https://pad.sigsum.org/p/db06-fa52-dd67-fe98
	* [bob] "started looking into X", "deployed Y", "fixed Z", etc.
		* Few talking points / key words that make the resulting minutes more useful
		* (May be omitted, keep it on the level "what is useful and simple")
		* (May be added as notes while the report is taking place)

You are not expected to read status reports in advance. We can have a micro discussion
for each status report, but anything lengthy is deferred until after the meet is done.

For example, you could say "I'm looking into X and would like to discuss Y after meet".

3. If you would like to propose a decision, create a decision item in the "Decision"
section in advance.  Add a question mark to emphasize that it is not decided yet.
	* a) Ensure that there is enough information available to take a decision
		* Usually in the form of having a status round item on the same topic
		* Some decisions don't need much context though, so keep it as simple as possible
	* b) Ping on irc before the meet starts that you are proposing a decision
		* "I'm working on X."
		* "Here's what you need to know"
		* "I'm adding this into the meet pad as a proposed decision, please take a look"
		* (Be reasonable about how much of a heads-up you give for people to look)
		* (Worst case, decision is deferred until next week if not enough time to look)
	* c) If you plan to attend the meet and be part of the decision:
		* Read-up on proposed decisions in advance
		* Think about what you want to decide and why
		* (Async feedback is of course also welcomed...)
	* d) Discuss and take decision together, e.g., "yes", "no", "needs more work", etc.
		* Prefix what is decided with "Decision: ", so that it is easy to grep in archive

4. Before the formal meet closes we self-assign next steps in the "Next steps" section.
Our next steps usually follow from status round and decisions, but is still explicit so
that it is easy to communicate to one another what we plan to (not) work on next.
	* Examples
	* [alice] sketch on a new meeting structure that would s/Discuss/Decision
	* [bob] give alice access to all sigsum systems

5. If useful links appeared on irc or during the meet, please put them in the "Other
useful links" section.  Add a one-liner description if useful.  For example:
	* Brief intro to singing with ssh tooling
		* https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/ssh_signatures

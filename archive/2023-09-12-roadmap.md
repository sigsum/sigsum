# 2023-09-12

This document provides a sketch of the current roadmap and involved people.

## Summary of changes

The last roadmap was documented and decided here:

  - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/archive/2023-05-16-roadmap.md
  - https://git.glasklar.is/sigsum/project/documentation/-/blob/main/archive/2023-05-16--meeting-minutes.md#decisions

The overall progress can be summarized as follows:

  - We have release candidates for the family of Sigsum specifications.  We are
    feeling particularly confident about the details specified in log.md now.
  - We identified important [insights][] wrt. connectivity between benign witnesses,
    and how that is related to the trust policy used by offline verifiers.  And
    related, some minor details that still [need to be patched][] in witness.md.
  - We improved the Sigsum tooling, such as fixing nits, bringing the prototype
    python witness up-to-speed, and making our monitor implementation more
    usable (e.g., by not fetching one inclusion proof per leaf in the log).

The updated roadmap aims to increase [Sigsum's readiness][].

The next roadmap update is planned to happened October 31, 2023.

## Roadmap

In rough order of priority:

  1. Specifications and documentation.  The goal is to cut v1 specifications and
     add missing documents that are crucial to increase Sigsum's readiness.
     1. witness.md, propose rc-2 which should ideally become the final v1 spec.
     2. bastion.md, propose rc-2 which should ideally become the final v1 spec.
     3. log.md, toggle release-candidate to become v1.
     4. Other documentation that is identified as missing
  2. Get started with operations
     1. Hash out good enough key management for Sigsum.  YubiHSMs are available.
     2. Start operating a current release of log-go, "production"
     3. Start operating a bastion host and witness that's interoperable, "test"
  3. Iterate on witnessing and monitoring
     1. witness-go, needs to become ready for test deployments
     2. bastion-go, needs to become ready for test deployments
     3. monitor-go, needs to become ready for test deployments.  Including how to
        tailor the implementation or its library hooks for an example use-case.
  4. Improve the "health" of log-go, e.g., including adding more metrics and
     fixing so that the operator can update some configurations dynamically.
  5. Improved integration/unit testing in log-go, also including support for
     multiple secondaries and better failover testing as well as documentation.
  6. Focus on website and more documentation.  Needs planning before starting.

Backlog tasks and clean-up is in-scope on a need-basis.  Log operator support
and bug fixing is also in scope and planned separately when needed.

We will not be working on (4) and forward until the next roadmap is set.  Our
current estimate for all of the above the end of 2023.  Once we're done, the
plan is to enter "maintenance" mode.  This includes bug fixing, support, patch
reviewing and merging, giving talks, growing the witnessing ecosystem, etc.

Parallel to "maintenance" mode we may also decide on further development topics
that relate to Sigsum.  These are (or will eventually be) documented separately
as GitLab issues, try filtering on the "Future" label for a partial overview.
You may also look for "DRAFT: " [milestones][] as yet another partial overview.

SSH signatures:

  - https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/ssh_signatures
  - https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/master/PROTOCOL.sshsig#L79
  - (might be a good read to also read some of the other docs in the same repo,
    just to get an idea of how, e.g., an SSH certificate looks; etc.)
  - (if you want some pointers on how to use SSH with a yubikey, you may want to
    take a quick look at https://gitlab.sigsum.org/glasklar/services/ssh/-/merge_requests/1)

API and design docs:

  - https://git.sigsum.org/sigsum/tree/doc/design.md
  - https://git.sigsum.org/sigsum/tree/doc/proposals
    - some of the 2022-07-* ones are open
    - see issues: https://gitlab.sigsum.org/sigsum/project/documentation/-/issues
    - see v1 milestone: https://gitlab.sigsum.org/groups/sigsum/-/milestones/1
    - (sorry that it's a bit messy that some stuff are at git.so and others
      not.  As you know we are currently migrating, both issues, milestones, and
      source code to be moved into the gitlab instance.)

Very brief sketch of the sigsum tool's usage message:

  - https://git.sigsum.org/sigsum-go/commit/?h=sigsum&id=43d190d1ec5f1964a85e7b5befe1cde8ab3107d6
  - especially the policy aspect and formats of the thing that the tool spits
    out is $TBD

Code is currently located at:

  - https://gitlab.sigsum.org/sigsum

(After reading for a bit it would be a good idea to try and run some things, like creating an SSH signature; curling some API endpoints, etc.  There's information about our POC instance in the log-go repo's README.)

	* Hello

	* Decisions
	* Next steps

Hello
	* rgdd
	* ln5
	* anwesha
	* rohonk

Status round
	* [rgdd] added issues in sigsum-{log,lib}-go
	* [rgdd] implemented experimental checkpoint endpoint
		* rgdd/checkpoint branch, not merged yet
	* [rgdd] making progress on sigsum-lib-go again
		* have a local sigsum-log-go branch that picks-up sigsum-lib-go ("feature parity")
		* this needs a little bit more work before being pushed though
	* [ln5] start on log operators bcp
		* https://git.sigsum.org/sigsum/tree/archive/2021-12-14-log-operators-bcp-dns
	* [ln5] collected more bits on the SSHSIG situation
		* it still seems to be a good idea for Sigsum
		* updated documentation is in progress
	* [ln5] started the onboarding of Anwesha, our new sysadmin
	* [ln5] new Ansible repo for Sigsum

Decisions
	* Decision: cancel weekly sigsum meet on Dec 28 due to holidays
	* Decision: adopt ssh signing format proposal
		* let the 'remove arbitrary bytes' proposal be orthogonal
		* let the question about supporting e.g. a NIST curve be orthogonal

Next steps
	* [rgdd] wrap up sigsum-lib-go changes
	* [rgdd] merge experimental checkpoint endpoint
	* [rgdd] update what is being signed according to ssh signing format proposal
	* [rohonk] continued work on formal security proof
	* [ln5] Document what we learned about SSHSIG wrt tooling
	* [ln5] Continued onboarding
	* [ln5] Signature verification tool expanded to reading SSH detached sigs as well
	* [anwesha] Automatic deletion of the pads from etherpad
	* [anwesha] Progress/study  Ansible
	* [anwesha] start knowing/learning about the project

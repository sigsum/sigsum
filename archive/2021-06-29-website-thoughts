What information is needed on sigsum.org?
	* rgdd needs somewhere to point people as he attends conferences, etc.
	* doesn't have to be perfect, but should also not be inconsistent

Before vaccay (?)
	* Identity
		* sigsum
		* anything about the ongoing project shaping?
	* How to get involved and/or stay updated
		* Day-to-day conversations happen on irc/oftc #sigsum, Matrix bridged
		* Open video/voice meeting on Jitsi, Tuesdays 1300 CEST
		* Meeting minutes and discuss documents are persisted every week
	* Where are our repositories right now

Later (not an exhaustive list)
	* Backdrop, origin story

Information places

# The Sigsum Project
Sigsum logging brings transparency to signed checksums.

Join the conversation at irc/oftc \#sigsum.  Our channel is bridged with [Matrix](https://app.element.io/#/room/#sigsum:matrix.org) to support web browsers, phones, etc. We have voice meetings on Jitsi every Tuesday, 1300 CEST.  Our channel and voice meetings are open for everyone.  We encourage you to come say hello, talk transparent logs, and get involved!

You can find more information here:
	* [sigsum](https://github.com/sigsum/sigsum): Documentation, meeting minutes, persisted pads, etc.
	* [sigsum-log-go](https://github.com/sigsum/sigsum-log-go): Trillian personality that implements sigsum logging
	* [sigsum-lib-go](https://github.com/sigsum/sigsum-lib-go): Go library and (soon) command line utilities that are useful for tooling purposes
	* [sigsum-witness-py](https://github.com/sigsum/sigsum-witness-py): Python witness that cosigns sigsum logs

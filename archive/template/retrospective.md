# Team retrospective

Template for a quick ~10-15m team retrospective.

## Is it clear what you're working on until the next planning meet?

## Is it clear what the project works towards the coming 6 months?

## Is it somewhat clear what the project may be working towards after that?

## Is someone available to provide input to your work in a timely manner?

I.e., is the feedback cycle short enough?  E.g., wrt. code review, discussion of
proposals, or anything else that you're doing in the project?

## Is there anything that I could do to make your working situation better?

## Anything else you would like to bring up?

## Copy-paste into pad

One question at a time, round-table.  Mix starting person for each question:

  - Is it clear what you're working on until the next planning meet?
  - Is it clear what the project works towards the coming 6 months?
  - Is it somewhat clear what the project may be working towards after that?
  - Is someone available to provide input to your work in a timely manner,
	i.e., is the feedback cycle short enough?  E.g., wrt. code review,
    discussion of proposals, or anything else that you're doing in the project?
  - Is there anything that I could do to make your working situation better?
  - Anything else you would like to bring up?

Note: the chair will take non-public notes.

Note: it is more than OK to say "pass" or "does not apply to me" etc.

Note: input with regards to the above questions is more than welcome.  E.g., if
you feel like a question is missing, or if an existing one doesn't add anything.

# Risk-averse attacker
reported by: rgdd

We used to have a paragraph in our threat model that emphasized that the
attacker we, and transparent logs in general, consider is risk-averse.

This paragraph was pulled because it simply stated properties about our attacker
without explaining why that is interesting.  The threat model text is fine
without it for now, but we should consider adding it in a proper way later on.

When we do, consider if we should cite these academic papers as well:

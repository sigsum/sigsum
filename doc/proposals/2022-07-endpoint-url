# Proposal

Drop the criteria that the constant "sigsum/v0" must be after a log's URL and
before a named endpoint.  This does not change the definition of a log URL, but
does mean "<endpoint>" is appended to it rather than "sigsum/v0/<endpoint>".

# Motivation

  - Protocol and version does not change for an active log and it should already
    be communicated to clients via policy.
  - A log operator that wants to specify protocol and/or version as part of
    their URL can still do so, either in their domain name or the optional path.

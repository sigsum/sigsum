# Sigsum Logging API v0
This document outlines the sigsum logging API, version 0.  The broader picture
is not explained here.  We assume that you are already familiar with the sigsum
logging [design document](https://git.sigsum.org/sigsum/tree/doc/design.md).

**Warning.**
This is a work-in-progress document that may be moved or modified.

## 1 - Overview
A log implements an HTTP(S) API for accepting requests and sending responses.

- Requests without any input data use the HTTP GET method.
- Requests with input data use the HTTP POST method.
- Input data in requests and output data in responses are expressed as
ASCII-encoded key/value pairs.
- Binary data is hex-encoded before being transmitted.

The motivation for using a text based key/value format for request and
response data is that it is simple to parse.  Note that this format is
not being used for the serialization of signed or logged data, where a
more well defined and storage efficient format is desirable.

A claimant should distribute log responses to their believers in any format that
suits them.  The (de)serialization required for _believers_ is a small subset of
Trunnel.  Trunnel is an "idiot-proof" wire-format in use by the Tor project.

## 2 - Primitives
### 2.1 - Cryptography
Logs use the same Merkle tree hash strategy as
[RFC 6962,ยง2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6962#section-2).
The hash functions must be
[SHA256](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/fips/180/4/final/documents/fips180-4-draft-aug2014.pdf).
Logs and witnesses must sign tree heads using
[Ed25519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032).

All other parts that are not Merkle tree related should use SHA256 as
the hash function.  Using more than one hash function would increases
the overall attack surface: two hash functions must be collision
resistant instead of one.

### 2.2 - Serialization
Log requests and responses are transmitted as ASCII-encoded key/value
pairs, for a smaller dependency than an alternative parser like JSON.
Some input and output data is binary: cryptographic hashes and
signatures.  Binary data must be base16-encoded, also known as hex
encoding.  Using hex as opposed to base64 is motivated by it being
simpler, favoring ease of decoding and encoding over efficiency on the wire.

We use the [Trunnel](https://gitweb.torproject.org/trunnel.git)
[description language](https://www.seul.org/~nickm/trunnel-manual.html)
to define (de)serialization of data structures that need to be signed or
inserted into the Merkle tree.  It is about as expressive as the
[TLS presentation language](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#section-3).
However, it is readable by humans _and_ machines.
"Obviously correct code" can be generated in C, Go, etc.

A fair summary of our Trunnel usage is as follows.

All integers are 64-bit, unsigned, and in network byte order.
Fixed-size byte arrays are put into the serialization buffer in-order,
starting from the first byte.  These basic types are concatenated to form a
collection.  You should not need a general-purpose Trunnel
(de)serialization parser to work with this format.  If you have one,
you may use it though.  The main point of using Trunnel is that it
makes a simple format explicit and unambiguous.

### 2.3 - Merkle tree
#### 2.3.1 - Tree head
A tree head contains a timestamp, a tree size, a root hash, and a key hash.

```
struct tree_head {
	u64 timestamp;
	u64 tree_size;
	u8 root_hash[32];
	u8 key_hash[32];
};
```
`timestamp` is the time since the UNIX epoch (January 1, 1970 00:00 UTC) in
seconds.  It is included so that monitors can be convinced of _freshness_ if
enough witnesses added their cosignatures, see below.

`tree_size` is the number of leaves in a log.

`root_hash` is a Merkle tree root hash that fixes a log's structure and content.

`key_hash` is a log's hashed public key.  The key is encoded as defined in
[RFC 8032, section 5.1.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032#section-5.1.2)
before hashing it.  The result is used as a unique log identifier that prevents
an [attack](https://git.sigsum.org/sigsum/tree/archive/2021-08-10-witnessing-broader-discuss#n95)
in multi-log ecosystems.

#### 2.3.2 - (Co)signed tree head
A signed tree head contains a tree head and a signature.
```
struct signed_tree_head {
	struct tree_head tree_head;
	u8 signature[64];
};
```

`tree_head` describes a log's state, see Section 2.3.1.

`signature` is a log's signature over `tree_head`.

A witness cosigns the same serialized _tree head_.  Note that tree heads are
scoped to a specific log to ensure that a witness signature for log X cannot be
confused with a witness signature for log Y.

A witness must not cosign a tree head if it is inconsistent with prior history
or if the timestamp is backdated more than 5 minutes.  A witness can be viewed
as playing two roles: Verifier(append-only) and Verifier(freshness)
[\[ts\]](https://git.sigsum.org/sigsum/tree/archive/2021-08-31-checkpoint-timestamp-continued#n84).

#### 2.3.3 - Tree leaf
Logs support a single leaf type.  It contains a claimant's statement,
signature, and key hash.

```
struct statement {
    u64 shard_hint;
    u8 checksum[32];
}

struct tree_leaf {
    struct statement statement;
    u8 signature[64];
    u8 key_hash[32];
}
```

`shard_hint` must match a log's shard interval and is determined by a claimant.

`checksum` represents some opaque data and is computed by a claimant.

`signature` is a signature over a serialized `statement`.  It must be possible
to verify this signature using the claimant's public verification key.

`key_hash` is a hash of the claimant's public verification key.  It is included
in `tree_leaf` so that each leaf can be attributed to a claimant.  A hash,
rather than the full public key, is used to motivate verifiers to locate the
appropriate key and make an explicit trust decision.

## 3 - Public endpoints
Every log has a fixed and unique base URL.  It must be a valid HTTP(S) URL that
can have the `/sigsum/v0/<endpoint>` suffix appended.  Example of a base URL:
`https://log.example.com/2021`.

Input data (in requests) is POST:ed in the HTTP message body as line-terminated
ASCII key/value pairs.  In more detail, the key-value format is `Key=Value\n`.
Everything before the first equal-sign is considered a key.
Everything after the first equal sign and before the next new line character is
considered a value.  Different keys may appear in any order.  A key may be
repeated, in which case the relative order must be preserved.  Example:
```
blue=first value for blue key
red=some value for red key
blue=second value for blue key
```

Output data (in replies) is sent in the HTTP message body using the same
key-value format as input data.

The HTTP status code is 200 OK to indicate success.  A different HTTP
status code is used to indicate failure.  A log must respond with a
human-readable string describing what went wrong using the key `error`.
Example:
```
error=Invalid signature
```

### 3.1 - get-tree-head-latest
Returns the latest signed tree head.  Used for debugging purposes.

```
GET <base url>/sigsum/v0/get-tree-head-latest
```

Input:
- None

Output:
- `timestamp`: `tree_head.timestamp`, ASCII-encoded decimal number.
- `tree_size`: `tree_head.tree_size`, ASCII-encoded decimal number.
- `root_hash`: `tree_head.root_hash`, hex-encoded.
- `signature`: log signature over a serialized `tree_head`, hex-encoded.

Note that `tree_head.key_hash` is known by the querying party.  Therefore, it is
not returned in Sections 3.1-3.3.

### 3.2 - get-tree-head-to-sign
Returns the latest signed tree head to be cosigned.  Used by witnesses.

```
GET <base url>/sigsum/v0/get-tree-head-to-sign
```

Input:
- None

Output on success:
- `timestamp`: `tree_head.timestamp`, ASCII-encoded decimal number.
- `tree_size`: `tree_head.tree_size`, ASCII-encoded decimal number.
- `root_hash`: `tree_head.root_hash`, hex-encoded.
- `signature`: log signature over a serialized `tree_head`, hex-encoded.

### 3.3 - get-tree-head-cosigned
Returns the latest cosigned tree head. Used together with `get-inclusion-proof`
and `get-consistency-proof`.  Ensures that verifiers see the same statements as
believers.

```
GET <base url>/sigsum/v0/get-tree-head-cosigned
```

Input:
- None

Output on success:
- `timestamp`: `tree_head.timestamp`, ASCII-encoded decimal number.
- `tree_size`: `tree_head.tree_size`, ASCII-encoded decimal number.
- `root_hash`: `tree_head.root_hash`, hex-encoded.
- `signature`: log signature over a serialized `tree_head`, hex-encoded.
- `cosignature`: witness signature over the same serialized `tree_head`,
  hex-encoded.
- `key_hash`: hashed witness verification key that can be used to verify the
  above cosignature.  The key is encoded as defined in [RFC 8032, section 5.1.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032#section-5.1.2)
  before hashing.  The resulting hash value is hex-encoded.

The `cosignature` and `key_hash` fields may repeat. The first witness signature
corresponds to the first key hash, the second witness signature corresponds to
the second key hash, etc.  At least one witness signature must be returned on
success.  The number of witness signatures and key hashes must match.

### 3.4 - get-inclusion-proof
```
POST <base url>/sigsum/v0/get-inclusion-proof
```

Input:
- `leaf_hash`: leaf identifying which `tree_leaf` the log should prove
  inclusion of, hex-encoded.
- `tree_size`: tree size of the tree head that the proof should be
  based on, ASCII-encoded decimal number.

Output on success:
- `leaf_index`: zero-based index of the leaf that the proof is based on,
  ASCII-encoded decimal number.
- `inclusion_path`: node hash, hex-encoded.

The leaf hash is computed using the RFC 6962 hashing strategy.  In
other words, `H(0x00 | tree_leaf)`.

`inclusion_path` must contain one or more hashes.  The order of node hashes
follow from the hash strategy, see RFC 6962.

Example: `echo "leaf_hash=241fd4538d0a35c2d0394e4710ea9e6916854d08f62602fb03b55221dcdac90f
tree_size=4711" | curl --data-binary @- localhost/sigsum/v0/get-inclusion-proof`

### 3.5 - get-consistency-proof
```
POST <base url>/sigsum/v0/get-consistency-proof
```

Input:
- `new_size`: tree size of a newer tree head, ASCII-encoded decimal number.
- `old_size`: tree size of an older tree head that the log should prove is
  consistent with the newer tree head, ASCII-encoded decimal number.

Output on success:
- `consistency_path`: node hash, hex-encoded.

`consistency_path` must contain one or more hashes.  The order of node
hashes follow from the hash strategy, see RFC 6962.

Example: `echo "new_size=4711
old_size=42" | curl --data-binary @- localhost/sigsum/v0/get-consistency-proof`

### 3.6 - get-leaves
```
POST <base url>/sigsum/v0/get-leaves
```

Input:
- `start_size`: index of the first leaf to retrieve, ASCII-encoded decimal
  number.
- `end_size`: index of the last leaf to retrieve, ASCII-encoded decimal number.

Output on success:
- `shard_hint`: `tree_leaf.statement.shard_hint`, ASCII-encoded decimal number.
- `checksum`: `tree_leaf.statement.checksum`, hex-encoded.
- `signature`: `tree_leaf.signature`, hex-encoded.
- `key_hash`: `tree_leaf.key_hash`, hex-encoded.

All fields may be repeated to return more than one leaf.  The first
value in each list refers to the first leaf, the second value in each
list refers to the second leaf, etc.  The size of each list must
match.

A log may return fewer leaves than requested.  At least one leaf
must be returned on success.

Example: `echo "start_size=42
end_size=4711" | curl --data-binary @- localhost/sigsum/v0/get-leaves`

### 3.7 - add-leaf
```
POST <base url>/sigsum/v0/add-leaf
```

Input:
- `shard_hint`: `tree_leaf.statement.shard_hint`, ASCII-encoded decimal number.
- `checksum`: `tree_leaf.statement.checksum`, hex-encoded.
- `signature`: `tree_leaf.signature`, hex-encoded.
- `verification_key`: public verification key that can be used to verify the
  above signature.  The key is encoded as defined in [RFC 8032, section 5.1.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032#section-5.1.2),
  then hex-encoded.
- `domain_hint`: domain name indicating where `tree_leaf.key_hash` can be found
  as a DNS TXT resource record with hex-encoding.

Output on success:
- None

A submission will not be accepted if `signature` is invalid or if the retrieved
key hash does not match the specified verification key.  A submission may also
not be accepted if the second-level domain name exceeded its rate limit.

Public logging must not be assumed to have happened until an inclusion proof is
available.  An inclusion proof should not be relied upon unless it leads up to a
trustworthy tree head.  Witness cosigning makes a tree head trustworthy.

Example: `echo "shard_hint=1640995200
checksum=cfa2d8e78bf273ab85d3cef7bde62716261d1e42626d776f9b4e6aae7b6ff953
signature=c026687411dea494539516ee0c4e790c24450f1a4440c2eb74df311ca9a7adf2847b99273af78b0bda65dfe9c4f7d23a5d319b596a8881d3bc2964749ae9ece3
verification_key=c9a674888e905db1761ba3f10f3ad09586dddfe8581964b55787b44f318cbcdf
domain_hint=example.com" | curl --data-binary @- localhost/sigsum/v0/add-leaf`

### 3.8 - add-cosignature
```
POST <base url>/sigsum/v0/add-cosignature
```

Input:
- `cosignature`: witness signature over `tree_head`, hex-encoded.
- `key_hash`: hashed witness verification key that can be used to verify the
  above cosignature.  The key is encoded as defined in [RFC 8032, section 5.1.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032#section-5.1.2)
  prior to hashing.  The resulting hash value is hex-encoded.

Output on success:
- None

`key_hash` can be used to identify which witness cosigned a tree head.  A
key-hash, rather than the full verification key, is used to motivate verifiers
to locate the appropriate key and make an explicit trust decision.

Note that logs must be configured with relevant witness public keys.

Example: `echo "cosignature=d1b15061d0f287847d066630339beaa0915a6bbb77332c3e839a32f66f1831b69c678e8ca63afd24e436525554dbc6daa3b1201cc0c93721de24b778027d41af
key_hash=662ce093682280f8fbea9939abe02fdba1f0dc39594c832b411ddafcffb75b1d" | curl --data-binary @- localhost/sigsum/v0/add-cosignature`

# The Sigsum Project
Sigsum is a free and open source project that brings transparency logging to
**sig**ned check**sum**s.  Logging _sigsums_ and not a concreter type like
_certificates_ keep the overall design simple and generally useful.

&#10004; Minimalistic design that simplifies log operations and usage </br>
&#10004; Centralised log operations but distributed trust assumptions </br>
&#10004; Discoverability of claims for the data of your choice</br>

In other words, what you claim about your data is up to you.  Examples could be 
	_everyone gets the same news articles_,
	_software package X builds reproducibly_, or
	_a list of key-value pairs is maintained with policy Y_.

Sigsum logging makes it reasonable to believe these claims by adding enough
discoverability to verify them.
